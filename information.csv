"We report a theoretical investigation on Goose-Hanchen (GH) effect for spin electrons across a magnetically confined GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs microstructure modulated by spin-orbit coupling [(SOC), including Rashba and Dresselhaus types]. An intrinsic symmetry in the device is broken by SOC, which gives rise to a considerable spin polarization effect in GH shifts of electrons. Both magnitude and direction of spin polarization can be manipulated by Rashba or Dresselhaus SOC, i.e., interfacial confining electric field or strain engineering. Based on such a semiconductor microstructure, a controllable spatial spin splitter can be proposed for spintronics applications.","Lu, MW; Chen, SY; Huang, XH; Zhang, GL",0,36,IEEE JOURNAL OF THE ELECTRON DEVICES SOCIETY,Spin Splitter Based on Magnetically Confined Semiconductor Microstructure Modulated by Spin-Orbit Coupling,2018
"We observed positive and negative Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts in plasmon-induced transparency (PIT) in a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) multi-layer structure based on the attenuated total reflection response. Here, the MIM waveguide (WG) mode and the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonance act as low-and high-Q resonances, respectively. SPP also induced the transparency window in otherwise opaque wavenumber (k) regions. The observed GH shifts were caused by the relevant k-domain dispersion in PIT, which is controllable through the adjustment of the coupling strength between the MIM WG and SPP resonances. This effect, thus, can be recognized as a rigorous counterpart of slow light in electromagnetically induced transparency and other related phenomena in the frequency domain. The tunable GH shift in PIT in a MIM structure would enable applications in beam steering devices and high-sensitivity sensors.

"We study the influence of the thermo-optic effect and of thermal expansion on the lateral shift experienced by a Gaussian near-infrared beam upon reflection from a voltage-controlled nematic liquid crystal cell deposited on a magnetic yttrium-iron garnet film. Variations of temperature are considered in the range between room temperature and the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature of the liquid crystal and induce changes in both the layer thicknesses and the permittivity tensor components of the constituents. We show that for all polarization configurations of the incoming and reflected beams, these changes modify the amplitude of the extrema of the lateral beam shift and their position with respect to the incidence angle of the beam and, except in the s-s polarization configuration, to the voltage applied to the liquid crystal cell. In the p-p and p-s polarization configurations, this drift can thus be controlled at some incidence angles by tuning the applied voltage. Moreover, in the p-s configuration, the lateral shift can be also controlled by a magnetization reversal in the magnetic layer. Finally, we discuss the possibility of temperature monitoring using the temperature dependence of the lateral shift in this system.

"The characteristics of an incident Gaussian monochromatic light beam at sharp critical angle are investigated and analyzed. The numerical results are obtained using fast Fourier transform based beam propagation method (FFT-BPM). In this study, we adapt the FFT-transverse electric (TE) polarizations. The field properties in the denser and rare medium are carefully examined. Further, the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift is calculated based on the lateral field using the FFT-BPM at sharp critical angle which cannot be obtained by other analytical methods. Moreover, the effects of the wavelength and denser medium refractive index on the GH shift are also investigated. The calculated results are in good agreement with that introduced in the literature. Moreover, the suggested analysis could shed light on more accurate modeling techniques for the GH shift calculation and its impact on the relevant photonic applications. In this regard, the calculated GH shifts at sharp critical angle are used for monitoring glucose concentration variations in biomedical applications with high sensitivity. Additionally, we presented for the first time to the authors' knowledge- the effect of the incident field pattern such as: Lorentz-Gauss, Super-Gaussian, Super-Lorentzian, and super-Lorentz-Gauss on the GH calculations.

"A new scheme focusing on modification and control of distortion in the reflection and transmission of Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifted beams, is discussed. The absorptivity, reflectivity, and transmissivity are measured for the new atomic scheme. The GH-shifted beam is modified by control fields and incident angle. The sum of absorption, transmission, and reflection coefficients is equal to one. For positive reflection GH-shift region, there is negative transmission GH shift. The distortion in the reflected and transmitted beam is controlled with incident angle and control fields. The results discussed in this article show significant applications in micro-optics and nano-optics, acoustics, and plasma physics.","Khan, H; Haneef, M",0,27,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,Distortion management of the Goos-Hanchen shifts in reflection-transmission beams,2018

"We demonstrated tailored plasmon-induced transparency (PIT) in a metal (Au)-insulator (SiO2)-metal (Ag) (MIM) structure, where the Fano interference between the MIM waveguide mode and the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonance mode induced a transparency window in an otherwise opaque wavenumber (k) region. A series of structures with different thicknesses of the Ag layer were prepared and the attenuated total reflection (ATR) response was examined. The height and width of the transparency window, as well as the relevant k-domain dispersion, were controlled by adjusting the Ag layer thickness. To confirm the dependency of PIT on Ag layer thickness, we performed numerical calculations to determine the electric field amplitude inside the layers. The steep k-domain dispersion in the transparency window is capable of creating a lateral beam shift known as the Goos-Hanchen shift, for optical device and sensor applications. We also discuss the Fano interference profiles in a omega - k two-dimensional domain on the basis of Akaike information criteria.","Matsunaga, K; Hirai, Y; Neo, Y; Matsumoto, T; Tomita, M",1,42,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Tailored plasmon-induced transparency in attenuated total reflection response in a metal-insulator-metal structure,2017
"A proposal on high-resolution electro-optical beam steering is conceptualized analytically using a long-range surface plasmon resonance configuration comprising a liquid crystal layer of E44 for 1550 nm wavelength. With the tuning of the refractive index of E44 through variations of applied voltage from 0 to 10 V, an optical beam steering can be attained considering the composite effect of spatial and angular Goos - Hanchen and Imbert Fedorov shifts. As compared with the existing beam shift processes in mu rad by mechanical means, here, the computed angular resolution is 3.40 nrad.

"The spin splitting of light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) is investigated theoretically in attenuated internal reflection in the Kretschmann configuration. The excitation of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) can significantly enhance the OAM-induced Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shift and the OAM-dependent spin splitting. The cooperation effect of these two shifts will result in an asymmetric spin splitting, which varies with the incident angle and polarization state. Specially, at the SPR angle, the OAMinduced IF shift vanishes, and the OAM-dependent spin splitting will cause a symmetric spin splitting. However, when the incident beam is horizontally polarized, the OAMinduced IF shift predominates. Thus the two spin components of the reflected will not be split; instead, they will be shifted together. This flexible control of the optical spin splitting can find applications in quantum information and precision metrology.

"The geometric phase visualization proposed by Bhandari (R Bhandari 1997 Phys. Rep. 281 1-64) in the ellipticity-ellipse orientation basis of the polarization ellipse of light is implemented to understand the geometric aspects of weak measurement. The weak interaction of a pre-selected state, acheived via spin-Hall effect of light (SHEL), results in a spread in the polarization ellipticity (eta) or ellipse orientation (chi) depending on the resulting spatial or angular shift, respectively. The post-selection leads to the projection of the eta spread in the complementary chi basis results in the appearance of a geometric phase with helical phase topology in the eta - chi parameter space. By representing the weak measurement on the Poincare sphere and using Jones calculus, the complex weak value and the geometric phase topology are obtained. This deeper understanding of the weak measurement process enabled us to explore the techniques' capabilities maximally, as demonstrated via SHEL in two examples-external reflection at glass-air interface and transmission through a tilted half-wave plate.","Samlan, CT; Viswanathan, NK",0,42,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,Geometric phase topology in weak measurement,2017
"Ray optics have proven to be an effcient and versatile tool to describe dielectric optical microcavities and their far-field emission based on the principle of ray-wave correspondence. Whereas often the well-known ray-optics at planar interfaces yields reasonable results, semiclassically and boundary-curvature induced corrections will become more important as the cavity size is further reduced. In this paper, we summarize the various ray optics descriptions of optical microresonators, in addition paying special attention to the differences that arise between chaotic versus non-chaotic (integrable or nearly integrable) resonator geometries, respectively. Whereas the far-field pattern in the chaotic case is known to be determined by the overlap of the unstable manifold with the leaky region, it results from the emission of trajectories with the smallest nonzero decay rates in the non-chaotic situation. We present an enhanced ray optical description, extended by wave-inspired (semiclassical) corrections, and discuss their consequences for the ray dynamics. In particular, we find clear indications for the presence of attractors resulting from the non-Hamiltonian character of the extended ray dynamics in phase space. We illustrate their impact on the far-field emission and show that it can considerably differ from the conventional ray description result.","Stockschlaeder, P; Hentschel, M",0,41,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,Consequences of a wave-correction extended ray dynamics for integrable and chaotic optical microcavities,2017
"Dipole interaction between spins induces a nonzero Berry curvature for magnons in ferromagnetic films, and this Berry curvature gives rise to various phenomena such as thermal Hall effect. In previous works, it has been calculated for magnons with dipole interaction only. Nevertheless, magnon dispersion is largely affected by the exchange interaction neglected in the previous works. In this paper, we calculated Berry curvature of magnons in ferromagnetic films with the dipole and exchange interactions. The resulting Berry curvature shows a sign change by varying the wave number, unlike that with the dipole interaction only. Besides, we calculate the Berry curvature at the anticrossings between magnon modes, and we find that hybridization between eigenmodes at anticrossings gives rise to a large peak in the Berry curvature. In addition, we calculate a shift of the magnon wave packet at the edge of the film coming from the Berry curvature, and it is enhanced at reflection at the anticrossing.","Okamoto, A; Murakami, S",0,36,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Berry curvature for magnons in ferromagnetic films with dipole-exchange interactions,2017
"Spin waves (SWs) are promising information carriers which can be used in modern magnonic devices, characterized by higher performance and lower energy consumption than presently used electronic circuits. However, before practical application of SWs, the efficient control over SW amplitude and phase needs to be developed. We analytically analyze reflection and refraction of the SWs at the interface between two ferromagnetic (FM) materials. In the model, we consider the system consisting of two semi-infinite FM media, separated by the ultra-narrow interface region with the magnetic anisotropy. We have found the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift for SWs in transmission and reflection, and performed detailed investigations of its dependence on the anisotropy at the interface and materials surrounding the interface. We have demonstrated the possibility of obtaining CH shift of several wavelengths in reflection for realistic material parameters. That proves the possibility for change of the SWs phase in FM materials at sub-wavelength distances, which can be regarded as a metasurface for magnonics.","Mailyan, M; Gruszecki, P; Gorobets, O; Krawczyk, M",0,24,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS,Goos-Hanchen Shift of a Spin-Wave Beam at the Interface Between Two Ferromagnets,2017
"In this paper, we discuss the phase management of Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts of a probe light through a cavity with a single-layer graphene nanostructure under a strong magnetic field. By using the quantum mechanical density matrix formalism we study the GH shifts of reflected and transmitted light beams. It is realized that negative or positive GH shifts can be achieved simultaneously by tuning some controllable parameters such as relative phase and the Rabi frequency of the applied fields. Moreover, the thickness effect of the cavity structure is considered as an effective parameter for adjusting the GH shifts of reflected and transmitted light beams. We find that by choosing suitable parameters, a maximum negative shift of 4.5 mm and positive shift of 5.4 mm are possible for GH shifts in reflected and transmitted light. Our proposed model may be useful for developing all-optical devices in the infrared region.","Solookinejad, G; Jabbari, M; Panahi, M; Sangachin, EA",0,44,LASER PHYSICS,Phase manipulation of Goos-Hanchen shifts in a single-layer of graphene nanostructure under strong magnetic field,2017
"In this work, we theoretically study the Goos-Hanchen effect of the reflected and transmitted light in an epsilonnear- zero (ENZ) slab. For a lossless ENZ slab, it is found that the Goos-Hanchen shifts are greatly enhanced near resonances for both TE-and TM-polarized beams, which is approximately inverse to the sufficiently small (but finite) value of permittivity. In a lossy ENZ slab, the reflected and transmitted GH shifts are different near resonances, and there are large negative GH shifts for the reflected beam and large positive shifts in the transmitted beam, and the detailed properties are discussed. There is similar behavior near the Brewster angle for TMpolarized light in both the lossy and lossless ENZ slabs. Compared with the results in the semi-infinite ENZ structure, our results may provide the richer control on the GH shifts in ENZ slabs and are potentially useful to design the ENZ-based optical devices.

"We propose a simple method for the precise identification of graphene layers at the air-prism interface via a pseudo-Brewster angle, where the horizontally polarized reflection is close to zero.

Furthermore, the sensitivity of the pseudo-Brewster angle can be greatly enhanced and reaches 0.04 deg by eliminating the influence of the cross-polarization effect.

"We theoretically predict a giant quantized Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect on the surface of graphene in the quantum Hall regime. The giant quantized GH effect manifests itself as an angular shift whose quantized step reaches the order of mrad for light beams impinging on a graphene-on-substrate system. The quantized GH effect can be attributed to quantized Hall conductivity, which corresponds to the discrete Landau levels in the quantum Hall regime. We find that the quantized step can be greatly enhanced for incident angles near the Brewster angle. Moreover, the Brewster angle is sensitive to the Hall conductivity, and therefore the quantized GH effect can be modulated by the Fermi energy and the external magnetic field. The giant quantized GH effect offers a convenient way to determine the quantized Hall conductivity and the discrete Landau levels by a direct optical measurement.","Wu, WJ; Chen, SZ; Mi, CQ; Zhang, WS; Luo, HL; Wen, SC",0,60,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Giant quantized Goos-Hanchen effect on the surface of graphene in the quantum Hall regime,2017

"We propose and demonstrate the weak measurement scheme to simultaneously measure the amplified angular and spatial contributions to the Goos-Hanchen (GH) and Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shifts, due to transmission through a glass plate.

The two cases are analyzed theoretically using Jones calculus of polarization formalism and the results are verified experimentally. In the first case of post-selection, the projection of the polarizer at. +/-Delta away from the crossed position amplifies the angular GH and IF shifts, while in the second case of post-selection, the projection of QWP at +/-Delta and polarizer kept fixed measures the polarization ellipticity in the beam and thus amplifies the spatial shift along with the angular shift simultaneously, for Delta << 1.","Prajapati, C; Viswanathan, NK",0,35,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,Simultaneous weak measurement of angular and spatial Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts,2017
"We propose a method for controlling the Imbert-Fedorov(IF) shifts of a reflected beam at a graphene-coated chiral metamaterial(CMM) interface, where graphene's chemical potential, the CMM's chirality parameter and the permittivity of dielectric at interface serve as external tunable stimuli to control the IF shifts. The spatial IF(SIF) shift and angular IF(AIF) shift are formulated by the reflection coefficients. The numerical results indicate that for p-polarized incident beam, the IF shifts can be controlled efficiently near the pseudo-Brewster angle through the chemical potential, and that both the high-permittivity dielectric and low-chirality CMM can bring about a broad shift modulation. Actually, the existence of graphene reduces the SIF shifts, but it can play a crucial role in the shift modulation.

"We analyze and compare the angular deviations for an optical beam reflected by and transmitted through a dielectric triangular prism. The analytic expressions derived for the angular deviations hold for arbitrary incidence angles. For incidence approaching the internal and external Brewster angles, the angular deviations transverse magnetic waves present the same behavior leading to the well-known giant Goos-Hanchen angular shift. For incidence near the critical angle a new region of large shift is seen both for transverse magnetic and transverse electric waves. While a direct measuring procedure is better in the vicinity of the Brewster region, a weak measurement breaks off the giant Goos-Hanchen effect, preserving the amplification in the critical region.

"Evanescent waves are ubiquitous at interfaces with optical, seismic or acoustic waves, and also with electron, neutron or atom beams. Newton was the first to suspect that both small time delays and spatial shifts exist during total internal reflection. However, these effects are so tiny that the spatial shifts were only observed in 1947 in optics, whereas the time delay values predicted by the Wigner model in the 10(-14) s range in optics had to await femtosecond lasers to be detected with difficulty. The spatial shifts have been isolated in many areas but the time delays, though fundamental, generally remain out of reach, particularly with particles. In textbooks usually both quantities are supposed to be simply linked. Here we report, using swivelling detectors, that the spatial and temporal measurements are intimately intermingled, especially in the so-called cyclical regime. Indeed, while the spatial shift does not depend on the type of detection, the measured time delay can be positive, negative or zero, but controllable. We also discuss how such intricate measurements of spatial and temporal effects allow crucial time penalties to be eliminated in guided soliton propagation, and should be used to unambiguously identify the Newton-Wigner time delays for particles.","Le Floch, A; Emile, O; Ropars, G; Agrawal, GP",0,40,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Dynamics and detection of the Newton-Wigner time delays at interfaces using a swivelling method,2017
"Metasurface serves as a promising plasmonic sensing platform for engineering the enhanced light-matter interactions. Here, a hyperbolic metasurface with the nanogroove structure in the subwavelength scale is designed. This metasurface is able to modify the wavefront and wavelength of surface plasmon wave with the variation of the nanogroove width or periodicity. At the specific optical frequency, surface plasmon polaritons are tightly confined and propagated with a diffraction-free feature due to the epsilon-near-zero effect. Most importantly, the groove hyperbolic metasurface can enhance the plasmonic sensing with an ultrahigh phase sensitivity of 30 373 deg RIU-1 and Goos-Hanchen shift sensitivity of 10.134 mm RIU-1.

"We show that a strongly enhanced coupling of spatially propagating electromagnetic waves to self-guiding unidirectional edge states (UESs) can be achieved by engineering a magnetic plasmonic gradient metasurface (GMS) made of an array of ferrite rods. The conversion efficiency of the incident photons into self-guiding UESs exhibits a transition from zero on an ordinary periodic surface to nearly 80 % on a surface incorporating a GMS. The underlying physics lies in that the magnetic plasmonic GMS enables a direct excitation of the edge states due to the band-folding or momentum compensation effect, which are in turn transformed into the self-guiding UESs on the ordinary periodic surface. The excitation of the UESs can also be revealed by considering the partial wave scattering amplitudes of the constituent rods on the surface, which manifests a change from a standing wave in the region subject to an external illumination to a self-guiding wave propagating and confined on the surface, a signature of UESs. The magnetic plasmonic GMS can also be used to implement the unidirectional phase control of the UES and the nonreciprocal Goos-Hanchen shift as a consequence of the time-reversal-symmetry breaking nature of the system and the strong coupling of the incident wave. In addition, the unidirectional features are shown to be flexibly controlled by either tailoring the gradient or tuning the external magnetic field, adding considerably to the performance of the magnetic plasmonic GMS systems.","Chen, HJ; Lu, WL; Li, JJ; Yu, JJ; Lin, ZF; Chan, CT; Liu, SY",2,66,PLASMONICS,Manipulating Unidirectional Edge States Via Magnetic Plasmonic Gradient Metasurfaces,2017

"Highly tunable enhanced lateral displacements in the center of gravity of a totally reflected light beam from a graphene plasmonic metasurface are investigated. Multiple reflections of the incident beam, and the resonance coupling between the incident beam and the surface modes of the graphene metasurface in each reflection, are employed to enhance the Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts in the proposed structure. It is shown that spatial Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts as high as 1089 lambda(0) and -44.66 lambda(0) (lambda(0): incident wavelength) are achievable in the proposed structure. The effects of different parameters, including the incident beam waist, temperature, the scattering time, and the chemical potential of the graphene, on the shift values are then studied. Because of the strong light confinement in the surface modes of the graphene metasurface, the dispersion properties of these modes, and, therefore, the coupling strength between the incident beam and these modes, are highly sensitive to the parameters of the reflecting structure and the incident beam itself. The high sensitivity of the coupling strength between the incident beam and the surface modes is then exploited to tune the shift values. It is shown that by introducing a small change of Delta mu(C) = 0.02 eV in the chemical potential of the graphene, the spatial Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov shift variations of 855 lambda(0) and -31 lambda(0) can be achieved, respectively. The wide range of lateral shift variations along with the relatively small required actuation power support the application of the proposed structure in the realization of optical devices, such as temperature sensors and switches.

"The spin Hall effect (SHE) of light, as an analogue of the SHE in electronic systems, is a promising candidate for investigating the SHE in semiconductor spintronics/valleytronics, high-energy physics and condensed matter physics, owing to their similar topological nature in the spin-orbit interaction. The SHE of light exhibits unique potential for exploring the physical properties of nanostructures, such as determining the optical thickness, and the material properties of metallic and magnetic thin films and even atomically thin two-dimensional materials. More importantly, it opens a possible pathway for controlling the spin states of photons and developing next-generation photonic spin Hall devices as a fundamental constituent of the emerging spinoptics.

"We report a distributed circuit modeling based on analytical study of the tunable enhanced lateral displacement of electromagnetic waves in total reflection of light beams from a graphene containing structure. The graphene containing structure considered here supports transverse magnetic surface modes whose dispersion properties can be controlled by applying an appropriate electrical voltage to the graphene. Using this property of the structure, coupling of the incident wave to the surface modes of the structure is used to enhance the lateral displacement of the totally reflected wave, known as Goos-Hanchen shift, while it is also shown that this large lateral shift can be controlled through adjusting the dispersion properties of the surface modes by applying an electrical voltage. Using the proposed circuit model, phase of the reflected plane wave is calculated to obtain the Goos-Hanchen shift under stationary phase approximation. This approximation is then modified by considering finite spatial width of the incident beam. Our calculations show that by coupling the incident wave to the surface modes of the structure, a giant Goos-Hanchen shift as high as 270 times of the free space wavelength; lambda(0), can be achieved. Furthermore, this large shift can be varied from 27 lambda(0) to 55 lambda(0) by changing the applied voltage from 0.5 V to 3 V. The results presented here can be used in designing graphene plasmonic based integrated optical devices such as optical switches.","Farmani, A; Miri, M; Sheikhi, MH",7,56,OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS,Analytical modeling of highly tunable giant lateral shift in total reflection of light beams from a graphene containing structure,2017
"For incidence in the critical region, the propagation of Gaussian lasers through dielectric blocks is characterized by the joint action of angular deviations and lateral displacements. This mixed effect, known as the composite Goos-Hanchen shift, produces a lateral displacement that is dependent on the axial coordinate, recently confirmed by a weak measurement experiment. We discuss under which conditions this axial lateral displacement, which only exists for the composite Goos-Hanchen shift, presents an oscillatory behavior. This oscillation phenomenon shows a peculiar behavior of light for critical incidence and, if experimentally tested, could stimulate further theoretical studies and lead to interesting optical applications.","Araujo, MP; De Leo, S; Maia, GG",1,28,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Oscillatory behavior of light in the composite Goos-Hanchen shift,2017
"The lateral shifts (i.e., the spatial GH shifts) of reflected wave from a uniaxial anisotropic chiral metamaterial slab are predicted based on the stationary-phase method. The two cases of the uniaxial chiral slab are investigated in detail. It is found that the negative uniaxial chiral slab can be realized for both the two cases as the group refraction of the left circularly polarized (LCP) wave is negative. The GH shifts of the perpendicular component (Delta(sp)) are similar for both of the cases, which are enhanced at close-to-grazing incidence. However, the GH shifts of the parallel component (Delta(pp)) can be enhanced near the Brewster angle. For case (I), by introducing a different chirality parameter and the thickness of the chiral slab, the transition between the positively and negatively enhanced GH shifts of the parallel component (Delta(pp)) can be realized. For case (II), the magnitude and the position of the enhancement of the positively enhanced GH shifts (Delta(pp)) can be tunable by adjusting the chirality and the thickness of the chiral slab.

The refractive index of the first layer is fixed. The second layer is an atomic system coupled by a strong laser field to realize the A-style electromagnetically induced transparency, and an additional microwave field drives the transition between the lower two levels to construct high refractive index with zero absorption. We use such phenomenon to modify the refractive index, and consequently the transverse shift in reflection. The properties of the atomic system and the transverse shift of reflected field are briefly studied. Our investigation shows that the shift can be tuned by the strength of the microwave field. And since the atomic system is quite sensitive to the phase of the light fields, through which the transverse shift can be manipulated effectively.

"Optical spin splitting has a promising prospect in quantum information and precision metrology. Since it is typically small, many efforts have been devoted to its enhancement. However, the upper limit of optical spin splitting remains uninvestigated. Here, we investigate systematically the in-plane spin splitting of a Gaussian beam reflected from a glass-air interface and find that the spin splitting can be enhanced in three different incident angular ranges: around the Brewster angle, slightly smaller than and larger than the critical angle for total reflection. Within the first angular range, the reflected beam can undergo giant spin splitting but suffers from low energy reflectivity. In the second range, however, a large spin splitting and high energy reflectivity can be achieved simultaneously. The spin splitting becomes asymmetrical within the last angular range, and the displacement of one spin component can be up to half of incident beam waist w(0)/2. Of all the incident angles, the spin splitting reaches its maximum at Brewster angle. This maximum splitting increases with the refractive index of the ""glass"" prism, eventually approaching an upper limit of w(0). These findings provide a deeper insight into the optical spin splitting phenomena and thereby facilitate the development of spin-based applications.","Zhu, WG; Yu, JH; Guan, HY; Lu, HH; Tang, JY; Zhang, J; Luo, YH; Chen, Z",1,28,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,The upper limit of the in-plane spin splitting of Gaussian beam reflected from a glass-air interface,2017

Two kinds of spin-orbit interaction and their role in beam shifts are discussed. Firstly, the interaction between the spin and intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG beam that produces polarization dependent angular shift which is further coupled to the angular momentum structure of the beam and gives rise to spatial shift in orthogonal direction. Secondly, the interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic OAM of the beam which produces polarization independent transverse shift, called orbital-Hall effect (OHE). Since the angular and spatial shifts are coupled and the angular shift is dependent on the beam waist, the beam shifts can be tuned to maximize or reduce the resultant shifts for LG beams.","Prajapati, C",3,33,OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS,Numerical calculation of beam shifts for higher-order Laguerre-Gaussian beams upon transmission,2017

"In this paper, we examine the tiny polarization rotation effect in total internal reflection due to the spin - orbit interaction of light. We find that the tiny polarization rotation rate will induce a geometric phase gradient, which can be regarded as the physical origin of photonic spin Hall effect. We demonstrate that the spin-dependent splitting in position space is related to the polarization rotation in momentum space, while the spin-dependent splitting in momentum space is attributed to the polarization rotation in position space. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum weak measurement to determine the tiny polarization rotation rate. The rotation rate in momentum space is obtained with 118 nm, which manifests itself as a spatial shift, and the rotation rate in position space is achieved with 38 mu rad/lambda, which manifests itself as an angular shift.

"We investigate the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts reflected and transmitted by a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) film for both normal and oblique incidence. It is found that the nonreciprocity effect of the MO material does not only result in a nonvanishing reflected shift at normal incidence, but also leads to a slab-thickness-independent term which breaks the symmetry between the reflected and transmitted shifts at oblique incidence. The asymptotic behaviors of the normal-incidence reflected shift are obtained in the vicinity of two characteris tic frequencies corresponding to a minimum reflectivity and a total reflection, respectively. Moreover, the coexistence of two types of negative-reflected-shift (NRS) at oblique incidence is discussed.

"Based on a Dirac-like Hamiltonian and coherent scattering formalism, we study the spin-valley transport and Goos-Hanchen-like (GHL) effect of transmitted and reflected electrons in a gated monolayer WS2. Our results show that the lateral shift of spin-polarized electrons is strongly dependent on the width of the gated region and can be positive or negative in both Klein tunneling and classical motion regimes. The absolute values of the lateral displacements at resonance positions can be considerably enhanced when the incident angle of electrons is close to the critical angle. In contrast to the time reversal symmetry for the transmitted electrons, the GHL shift of the reflected beams is not invariant under simultaneous interchange of spins and valleys, indicating the lack of spin-valley symmetry induced by the tunable potential barrier on the WS2 monolayer.

However, a quantitative understanding of the edge-reflections, including reflection phases and diffraction effects, has remained elusive.

"We investigate the Goos Hanchen shift for ballistic electrons (i) reflected from a step-like inhomogeneity of the potential energy and (or) effective mass, and (ii) transmitted through a ferromagnetic barrier region in monolayer silicene or gapped graphene. For the electrons reflected from a single interface we found that the Goos-Hanchen shift is valley-polarized for gapped graphene structure, and valley- and spin-polarized for silicene due to the spin-valley coupling. In contrast, for example, to gapless graphene the lateral beam shift in gapped structures occurs not only in the case of total, but also of partial, reflection, i.e. at the angles smaller than the critical angle of total reflection. We have also demonstrated that the valley- and spin-polarized displacement of the electron beam, transmitted through a ferromagnetic silicene barrier, resonantly depends on the barrier width. The resonant values of the displacement can be controlled by adjusting the electric potential, the external perpendicular electric field, and the exchange field induced by an insulating ferromagnetic substrate.","Azarova, ES; Maksimova, GM",2,39,JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS,Spin- and valley-dependent Goos-Hanchen effect in silicene and gapped graphene structures,2017
"A new theoretical approach towards the composite effect of spatial and angular Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift and Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shift for the Gaussian beam, Laguerre-Gaussian beam and Bessel beam with long range surface plasmon (LRSP) resonance is observed, designed and simulated through the variation of incident angle at a wavelength of 1550 nm where the four layered Kreschmann-Rather geometry comprises a ZnSe prism, a liquid crystal layer of E44 and two metal layers of silver. To the best of our knowledge several articles have been devoted, separately considering the Gaussian beam, Laguerre-Gaussian beam and Bessel beam without considering the effect of spatial and angular GH shift and IF shift whereas the exact output beam position can only be identified with the composite effect of these shifts.

"Decades of work on beam deformation on reflection and especially on lateral shifts have spread the idea that a reflected beam is larger than the incident beam. However, when the right conditions are met, a beam reflected by a multilayered resonant structure can be 10% narrower than the incoming beam. Such an easily measurable change occurs on a very narrow angular range close to a resonance, which can be leveraged to improve the resolution of sensors based on the detection of surface-plasmon resonances by a factor of 3. We provide theoretical tools to deal with this effect and a thorough physical discussion that leads to expect similar phenomena to occur for temporal wave packets and in other domains of physics.","Polles, R; Mihailovic, M; Centeno, E; Moreau, A",0,30,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Leveraging beam deformation to improve the detection of resonances,2016

"Slowing down or even stopping light is the first task to realising optical information transmission and storage. Theoretical studies have revealed that metamaterials can slow down or even stop light; however, the difficulty of preparing metamaterials that operate in visible light hinders progress in the research of slowing or stopping light. Metasurfaces provide a new opportunity to make progress in such research. In this paper, we propose a dendritic cell cluster metasurface consisting of dendritic structures. The simulation results show that dendritic structure can realise abnormal reflection and refraction effects. Single-and double-layer dendritic metasurfaces that respond in visible light were prepared by electrochemical deposition. Abnormal Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts were experimentally obtained. The rainbow trapping effect was observed in a waveguide constructed using the dendritic metasurface sample. The incident white light was separated into seven colours ranging from blue to red light. The measured transmission energy in the waveguide showed that the energy escaping from the waveguide was zero at the resonant frequency of the sample under a certain amount of incident light. The proposed metasurface has a simple preparation process, functions in visible light, and can be readily extended to the infrared band and communication wavelengths.","Fang, ZH; Chen, H; Yang, FS; Luo, CR; Zhao, XP",2,34,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Slowing down light using a dendritic cell cluster metasurface waveguide,2016
"We suggest a scheme to control Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift in an ensemble of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms, which act as super-atoms due to the dipole blockade mechanism. The ensemble of three-level cold Rydberg-dressed (Rb-87) atoms follows a cascade configurations where two fields, Le, a strong control and a weak field are employed [D. Petrosyan, J. Otterbach, and M. Fleischhauer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 213601 (2011)]. The propagation of probe field is influenced by two-photon correlation within the blockade distance, which are damped due to the saturation of super-atoms. The amplitude of GH shift in the reflected light depends on the intensity of probe field. We observe large negative GH shift in the reflected light for small values of the probe field intensities.

"In this work, based on the quantum process of the Goos-Hanchen (GH) spatial shift, a quantum process of the GH angular shift is also theoretically investigated. Then, the coherence between spatial and angular shifts in the GH effect is discovered and developed to manipulate the final total displacement for a digital optical switch. It is found that a waveguide corner structure always makes the reflected guide-mode have a GH angular shift in the minus direction when the incident beam is in the Brewster angle vicinity, while it always makes the spatial shift in the plus direction. Meanwhile, the coherence of these two GH shifts has an interesting distribution with the incident angle, and only in the common linear response area to the incident angle, the two GH shifts are mutually enhancing, and then a mini refractive index modulation of the guided-mode at the reflecting interface can create a great stable jump of reflected beam displacement at an eigenstate under the GH effect. As a result, on the 220 nm CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator waveguide platform, with a tapered multimode interference (MMI) waveguide, a 5 x 10(18) cm(-3) concentration variation of free carriers can create an absolute digital total displacement of 8-25 mu m of the reflected beam on the MMI waveguide output end, leading to a 1 x 5 scale digital optical switching function.

"Quantum weak measurements, wavepacket shifts and optical vortices are universal wave phenomena, which originate from fine interference of multiple plane waves. These effects have attracted considerable attention in both classical and quantum wave systems. Here we report on a phenomenon that brings together all the above topics in a simple one-dimensional scalar wave system. We consider inelastic scattering of Gaussian wave packets with parameters close to a zero of the complex scattering coefficient. We demonstrate that the scattered wave packets experience anomalously large time and frequency shifts in such near-zero scattering. These shifts reveal close analogies with the Goos-Hanchen beam shifts and quantum weak measurements of the momentum in a vortex wavefunction. We verify our general theory by an optical experiment using the near-zero transmission (near-critical coupling) of Gaussian pulses propagating through a nano-fibre with a side-coupled toroidal micro-resonator.

Goos-Hanchen (G-H) effect is of great interest in the manipulation of optical beams. However, it is still fairly challenging to attain efficient controls of the G-H shift for diverse applications. Here, a mechanism to realize tunable G-H shift in the terahertz regime with electrically controllable graphene is proposed. Taking monolayer graphene covered epsilon-near-zero metamaterial as a planar model system, it is found that the G-H shifts for the orthogonal s-polarized and p-polarized terahertz beams at oblique incidence are positive and negative, respectively. The G-H shift can be modified substantially by electrically controlling the Fermi energy of the monolayer graphene. Reversely, the Fermi energy dependent G-H effect can also be used as a strategy for measuring the doping level of graphene. In addition, the G-H shifts of the system are of strong frequency-dependence at oblique angles of incidence, therefore the proposed graphene hybrid system can potentially be used for the generation of terahertz ""rainbow,"" a flat analog of the dispersive prism in optics. The proposed scheme of hybrid system involving graphene for dynamic control of G-H shift will have potential applications in the manipulation of terahertz waves.","Fan, YC; Shen, NH; Zhang, FL; Wei, ZY; Li, HQ; Zhao, Q; Fu, QH; Zhang, P; Koschny, T; Soukoulis, CM",32,54,ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS,Electrically Tunable Goos-Hanchen Effect with Graphene in the Terahertz Regime,2016

"The linear birefringence of uniaxial crystal plates has been known since the 17th century, and it is widely used in numerous optical setups and devices.

The well-known linear birefringence and the new circular birefringence form an interesting analogy with the Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov beam shifts that appear in the light reflection at a dielectric interface.

"High precision measurements of optical beam shifts are important in various fields including sensing, atomic force microscopy, and measuring beam shifts at interfaces. Sub-micron shifts are generally measured by indirect techniques such as weak measurements. We demonstrate a straightforward and robust measurement scheme for the shift, based on a scanning quadrant photodiode (QPD) that is biased using a low noise electronic circuit. The shift is measured with respect to a reference beam that is co-propagating with the signal beam. Thus, the shift of the signal beam is readout directly as the difference between the x-intercepts of the QPD scan plot of the signal and reference beams versus the position of the detector. To measure the beam shift, we use polarization multiplexing scheme where the p-polarized signal and s-polarized reference beams are modulated at two different frequencies and co-launched into a polarization-maintaining fiber. Both the signal and reference beam positions are readout by two lock-in amplifiers simultaneously. In order to demonstrate the utility of this method, we perform a direct measurement of Goos-Hanchen shift of a beam that is reflected from a plane gold surface.

"We present the three-layer model to calculate the surface second-harmonic generation (SSHG) yield. This model considers that the surface is represented by three regions or layers. The first layer is the vacuum region with a dielectric function epsilon(v)(omega) = 1 from where the fundamental electric field impinges on the material. The second layer is a thin layer (l) of thickness d characterized by a dielectric function epsilon(L)(omega), and it is in this layer where the SSHG takes place. The third layer is the bulk region denoted by b and characterized by epsilon(b)(omega). Both the vacuum and bulk layers are semi-infinite. The model includes the multiple reflections of both the fundamental and the second-harmonic (SH) fields that take place at the thin layer l. We obtain explicit expressions for the SSHG yield for the commonly used s and p polarizations of the incoming 1 omega and outgoing 2 omega electric fields, where no assumptions for the symmetry of the surface are made. These symmetry assumptions ultimately determine which components of the surface nonlinear second-order susceptibility tensor chi(-2 omega;omega,omega) are different from zero, and thus contribute to the SSHG yield. Then, we particularize the results for the most commonly investigated surfaces, the (001), (110), and (111) crystallographic faces, taking their symmetries into account. We use the three-layer model and compare it against the experimental results of a Si(111)(1 x 1): H surface, as a test case, and use it to predict the SSHG yield of a Si(001)(2 x 1) surface.","Anderson, SM; Mendoza, BS",1,48,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Three-layer model for the surface second-harmonic generation yield including multiple reflections,2016

"We examine the Goos-Hanchen (G-H) shift of a Gaussian beam reflected on a thin slab of Ag/TiO2 hyperbolic multilayer metamaterial (HMM).

It can be about 40 mu m which are far bigger than the G-H shifts on the usual materials like metals and dielectrics. The enhancement is due to the excitation of the Brewster modes in HMM. Such Brewster modes in HMM have a well-defined frequency-dependent line shape. We relate the the half width at half maximum of the G-H shift to the imaginary part of the complex frequency of the Brewster mode. Moreover, we also present results for the Imbert-Fedorov shifts as well as the spin Hall effect of light on the surface of a thin HMM slab.

"In a planar optical cavity, the resonance frequencies increase as a function of in-plane wavevector according to a standard textbook formula. This has well-known consequences in many different areas of optics, from the shifts of etalon peaks at non-normal angles, to the properties of transverse modes in laser diodes, to the effective mass of microcavity photons, and so on. However, this standard formula is valid only when the reflection phase of each cavity mirror is approximately independent of angle. There is a certain type of mirror-a subwavelength dielectric grating near a guided mode resonance-with not only a strongly angle-dependent reflection phase, but also very high reflectance and low losses. Simulations show that by using such mirrors, high-quality-factor planar cavities can be designed that break all these textbook rules, leading to resonant modes that are slow, stopped or even backward-propagating in the in-plane direction.

Goos-Hanchen shift is a special optical phenomenon. With the development of the nano-optics, Goos-Hanchen shift has become one of the most valuable and hottest issues in optical field. Meanwhile, due to the unique feature of the near-zero-refractive-index material, it has been used in many fields, but the effect of Goos-Hanchen shift has little studied and received less attention. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the Goos-Hanchen shift based on near-zero-refractive-index material. In the paper, the photonic crystal with specific parameter is used to simulate the near-zero-refractive-index material, and the measurement in the simulation is based on finite difference time domain. We approach the issue by studying whether and how the wavelength and temperature will affect the Goos-Hanchen shift based on near-zero-refractive-index material. After the simulation at different wavelengths and temperatures based on the incidence angle which gives rise to total reflection, the results of the simulation reveal that when wavelength is between 1.648 alpha and 1.848 alpha (not including 1.848 alpha), the Goos-Hanchen shift is positive and increases gradually, and the total reflection angle decreases. When wavelength is between 1.848 alpha and 2.048 alpha, the total reflection angle increases. When the wavelength is in a range between 1.848 a and 1.858 a, the Goos-Hanchen shift is negative. When the wavelength is above 1.848 alpha, the Goos-Hanchen shift is negative and increases gradually. When the temperature increases from 0 degrees C to 100 degrees C, the Goose-Hanchen shift is unsimilar to the situation of different wavelengths, and fluctuates in the interval at wavelengths ranging from 1.648 alpha to 1.848 alpha , and the total reflection angle increases gradually. Goose-Hanchen shift decreases at a wavelength of 2.048, and the total reflection angle decreases gradually, but a little. Based on the simulation result, it is concluded that the variations of the wavelength and temperature will affect the Goos-Hanchen shift based on near-zero-refractive-index material, and the effective value is in a range from about 1 alpha to 4 alpha, which is not a small value to the shift especially in some precision instruments. As a result, the changes of wavelength and temperature should be taken into consideration, when Goos-Hanchen shift based on near-zero-refractive-index materials is measured or used in research. These findings are expected to be instructive for device design and nano-optics.","Lu, ZR; Liang, BM; Ding, JW; Chen, JB; Zhuang, SL",0,22,ACTA PHYSICA SINICA,Goos-Hanchen shift based on nearzero-refractive-index materials,2016

"The quantum Goos-Hanchen shifts of the transmitted, electron beam through an AA-stacked bilayer graphene superlattices are investigated. We found that the band structures of graphene superlattices can have more than one Dirac point, their locations do not depend on the number of barriers. It was revealed that any n-barrier structure is perfectly transparent at normal incidence around the Dirac points created in the superlattices. We showed that the Goos-Hanchen shifts display sharp peaks inside the transmission gap around two Dirac points (E = V-B + tau, E = V-W + tau), which are equal to those of transmission resonances. The obtained Goos-Hanchen shifts are exhibiting negative as well as positive behaviors and strongly depending on the location of Dirac points. It is observed that the maximum absolute values of the shifts increase as long as the number of barriers is increased. Our analysis is done by considering four cases: single, double barriers, superlattices without and with defect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We present a theoretical investigation of the Goos-Hanchen effect upon light reflection from a heterostructure consisting of an electro-optic film deposited on a magneto-electric film grown on a nonmagnetic dielectric substrate. It is shown that the linear magneto-electric interaction leads to an increase of the lateral shift even in the absence of any applied electric field. The presence of the electro-optic layer enables the control of the Goos-Hanchen shift and of the position of its maximum (with respect to the angle of incidence) through a variation of the magnitude and orientation of an applied electric field. It is also demonstrated that applying an external magnetic field in order to reverse the magnetization in the magnetic layer results (under the influence of the magnetoelectric interaction in the system) in a sign reversal of the lateral shift but a nonreciprocal change of its amplitude.

"We have theoretically studied the Goos-Hanchen-like shift of spinor-unpolarized beams tunneling through various gate-biased silicene nanostructures. Following the stationary-phase method, lateral displacement in single-, dual-, and multiple-gated silicene systems has been systematically demonstrated. It is shown for simple single-gated silicene that lateral displacement can be generally enhanced by Fabry-Perot interference, and near the transition point turning on the evanescent mode a very large lateral shift could be observed. For the dual-gated structure, we have also shown the crucial role of localized modes like quantum well states in enhancing the beam lateral displacement, while for the multiple gate-biased systems the resulting superlattice subbands are also favorable for lateral displacement enhancement. Importantly, including the degeneracy-broken mechanisms such as gate-field and magnetic modulations, a fully spinor-resolved beam can be distinguished from the rest counterparts by aligning the incident beam with a proper spinor-resolved transition point, localized state, and subband, all of which can be flexibly modulated via electric means, offering the very desirable strategies to achieve the fully spinor-polarized beam for functional electronic applications.

We theoretically show that by modulation of the external coupling field, incoherent pumping rates, and detuning of the probe light, the GH shifts in the reflected and transmitted probe light can be controlled. Our results show that enhanced GH shifts of reflected and transmitted probe beams can be obtained by simultaneous use of incoherent pumping rates and detuning of the probe light.

"The spatial and the angular variants of the Imbert-Federov (IF) beam shifts and the angular Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift contribute in a complex interrelated way to the resultant beam shift in partial reflection at planar dielectric interfaces.

"The Artmann formula provides an accurate determination of the Goos-Hanchen lateral displacement in terms of the light wavelength, refractive index, and incidence angle. In the total reflection region, this formula is widely used in the literature and confirmed by experiments. Nevertheless, for incidence at critical angle, it tends to infinity and numerical calculations are needed to reproduce the experimental data. In this paper, we overcome the divergence problem at critical angle and find, for Gaussian beams, a closed formula in terms of modified Bessel functions of the first kind. The formula is in excellent agreement with numerical calculations and reproduces, for incidence angles greater than critical ones, the Artmann formula. The closed form also allows one to understand how the breaking of symmetry in the angular distribution is responsible for the difference between measurements done by considering the maximum and the mean value of the beam intensity. The results obtained in this study clearly show the Goos-Hanchen lateral displacement dependence on the angular distribution shape of the incoming beam.

By applying an effective local response theory formulated recently in the literature, it is found that nonlocal effects only affect p polarized light in this Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift of the incident beam; leading to a blue-shifted peak for positive shifts at high frequencies and red-shifted dip for negative shifts at low frequencies in the GH shift spectrum.

"We simulated and analyzed Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts of 633 nm polarized light through a two-prism structure, consisting of a right triangle prism and an isosceles triangle prism with Kretschmann-Raether configuration, by comparing the results from COMSOL Multiphysics (CM) simulation software with that of a stationary-phase analysis (SPA).

Using CM at an incident angle of 43.8 degrees, we found the maximum positive GH shift of 9.45 mu m. The results obtained using CM are in agreement with those obtained by the SPA around the resonance angle, although the enhancement effect from CM is much less than that of SPA. This is because SPA depends on the differentiation of the phase shift with respect to the incident angle, while a drastic phase shift occurs at the resonance angle. These results are useful for designing high-sensitivity SPR sensors based on GH shift measurement and for application in waveguide-type SPR devices, with sizes in the order of micro millimeter.","Zhang, WJ; Zhang, ZW; Yang, P; Zhu, X; Dai, YF",0,16,OPTICAL MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY AND INSTRUMENTATION,Goos-Hanchen shifts at a resonance angle of a two-prism structure using COMSOL Multiphysics,2016

Over the last few years, the Goos-Hanchen effect has been investigated for specific metamaterial interfaces including graphene-on-dielectric surfaces, negative index materials and epsilon near -zero materials. In this contribution, we generalize the approach for the investigation of the Goos-Hanchen effect based on the geometric formalism of transformation optics. Although this metamaterial design methodology is generally applied to manipulate the propagation of light through continuous media, we show how it can also be used to describe the reflections arising at the interface between a vacuum region and a transformed region with a metamaterial implementation. Furthermore, we establish an analytical model that relates the magnitude of the Goos-Hanchen shift to the underlying geometry of the transformed medium. This model shows how the dependence of the Goos-Hanchen shift on geometric parameters can be used to dramatically enhance the size of the shift by an appropriate choice of permittivity and permeability tensors. Numerical simulations of a beam with spatial Gaussian profile incident upon metamaterial interfaces verify the model and firmly establish a novel route towards Goos-Hanchen shift engineering using transformation optics.","Lambrechts, L; Ginis, V; Danckaert, J; Tassin, P",0,49,METAMATERIALS X,Transformation Optics Approach for Goos-Hanchen Shift Enhancement at Metamaterial Interfaces,2016
"We examine the spectral characteristic of Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect in a plasmonic waveguide, and take into account the influence of thickness of gold, silica and water index on GH shift. The GH shift variation with incident light wavelength can be used to design wavelength selector in wavelength de-multiplexing technology. We also give the GH shift peak for different glucose water to explore an effective method to measure glucose concentration. The GH peaks show a periodic property, whose period is narrowed with the increase of silica thickness. A refractive index sensor based on spectral characteristic of GH effect can be realized in the proposed plasmonic waveguide. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

"For a long time, it was believed there was no reason to include the geometrical phase in studying the propagation of gaussian optical beams through dielectric blocks. This can be justified by the fact that the first-order term in the Taylor expansion of this phase is responsible for the lateral shift of the optical beam which is also predicted by ray optics. From this point of view, the geometrical phase can be seen as a purely auxiliary concept. In this paper, we show how the second-order term in the Taylor expansion accounts for the symmetry breaking of the transversal spatial distribution and acts as an axial spreading modifier. These new effects clearly show the importance of the geometrical phase in describing the correct behavior of light. To test our theoretical predictions, we briefly discuss a possible experimental implementation.","Araujoa, MP; De Leo, S; Lima, M",2,37,JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS,Transversal symmetry breaking and axial spreading modification for gaussian optical beams,2016
"We discuss the lateral shift (LS) and the angular shift (AS) of a reflected Gaussian beam from the interface covered with a graphene sheet, which is modeled as an infinitesimally thin surface conductivity. In the two cases where the incident medium is optically rarer or denser than the refractive medium, the LS and AS are numerically analyzed for a TM-polarized beam by using the stationary-phase approach. It is found that both the LS and AS can be controlled by tuning graphene's chemical potential, the frequency or the angle of incidence of incident beam. In particular, when the incident medium is optically denser, since the total internal reflection takes place and the surface plasmon polaritons are excited, the larger AS can be achieved around the critical angle, the pseudo-Brewster angle or resonance angle. Also, a higher chemical potential can tune the directions of the LS (i.e., the positive or negative shifts). The results provide a way to tune flexibly the LS and AS by means of the graphene sheet.

"The Goos-Hanchen effect of light reflected from sandwich (three-layered) structures composed of a superconducting YBa2Cu3O7 film and two different dielectric films is investigated theoretically. It has been shown that optical anisotropy of YBa2Cu3O7 film, as well as its positions in the threelayer specimen, strongly effects on the lateral shift values. We have shown that, for all positions of the superconducting film in the three-layered structure, variation of temperature makes possible to control the values of the lateral shift of TE-polarized light at the incidence angles close to pseudo-Brewster angles, whereas for TM-polarized light the lateral shift is only significant at grazing incidence.

"Scientists have known for more than a century that light possesses both linear and angular momenta along the direction of propagation. However, only recent advances in optics have led to the notion of spinning electromagnetic fields capable of carrying angular momenta transverse to the direction of motion. Such fields enable numerous applications in nano-optics, biosensing and near-field microscopy, including three-dimensional control over atoms, molecules and nanostructures, and allowing for the realization of chiral nanophotonic interfaces and plasmonic devices.

"Light carries both spin and orbital angular momentum. These dynamical properties are determined by the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of light. Nano-optics, photonics and plasmonics tend to explore subwavelength scales and additional degrees of freedom of structured - that is, spatially inhomogeneous - optical fields. In such fields, spin and orbital properties become strongly coupled with each other. In this Review we cover the fundamental origins and important applications of the main spin-orbit interaction phenomena in optics. These include: spin-Hall effects in inhomogeneous media and at optical interfaces, spin-dependent effects in nonparaxial (focused or scattered) fields, spin-controlled shaping of light using anisotropic structured interfaces (metasurfaces) and robust spin-directional coupling via evanescent near fields. We show that spin-orbit interactions are inherent in all basic optical processes, and that they play a crucial role in modern optics.","Bliokh, KY; Rodriguez-Fortuno, FJ; Nori, F; Zayats, AV",211,142,NATURE PHOTONICS,Spin-orbit interactions of light,2015
"We present a theoretical analysis showing that layered topological insulators, for example, Bi2Se3 are optically hyperbolic materials in the range of terahertz (THz) frequencies. As such, these topological insulators possess deeply subdiffractional, highly directional collective modes: hyperbolic phonon polaritons. We predict that in thin crystals the dispersion of these modes is split into discrete subbands and is strongly influenced by electron surface states. If the surface states are doped, then hybrid collective modes result from coupling of the phonon polaritons with surface plasmons. The strength of the hybridization can be controlled by an external gate that varies the chemical potential of the surface states. We also show that the momentum dependence of the plasmon-phonon coupling leads to a polaritonic analog of the Goos-Hanchen effect. The directionality of the polaritonic rays and their tunable Goos-Hanchen shift is observable via THz nanoimaging.","Wu, JS; Basov, DN; Fogler, MM",9,69,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Topological insulators are tunable waveguides for hyperbolic polaritons,2015

"The Goos-Hanchen shift of the reflected beam in a standing-wave coupled electromagnetically induced transparency medium is investigated. We adopt the three-level. system as a model of Rb-87 atomic media. Under the influence of two counterpropagating coupling fields, the incident beam is converted into a reflected one, with the Goos-Hanchen shift. We briefly discuss the rules for obtaining efficient reflection in such an atomic system, and carefully investigate the Goos-Hanchen shift and its dependence on the beam width of the incident field. Both the cases with and without Doppler broadening are considered. In order to provide a clearer physical picture on the large shift that could be realized, the concept of penetration depth is used to analyze the shift phenomeno-logically.

"The Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect induced by the total reflection of an incident beam of P-wave from a low-impedance medium to a high-impedance medium at near- and post-critical angles was theoretically simulated and discussed. For both PP- and PSV-waves, there may be large GH shifts (GHS) and penetration depths (PD) for both lossless and attenuating media. As the Q-factor increases, or the frequency of the seismic wave decreases, the GH effect is increased. However, in attenuating media, there may be non-zero GHS and PD at all non-zero incident angles, not just post-critical angles. GHS may be either positive or negative, while PD is positive only. Compared to the Q-factor in the incident medium, the Q-factor in the transmission medium may play a more dominant role in the determination of reflection coefficients, GHS, and PD. The GH-induced normal moveout (NMO) discrepancy of the PSV-wave may be larger than that of the PP-wave. Due to the GH effect, there may be an angle discrepancy (at fixed offset) between the GH-modified incident angle and the traditional incident angle. In addition, the GH effect at a given offset may produce two or three reflected waves, from different incident angles. These results suggest that, within their assumptions, the GH effect may lead to errors in NMO estimates and the vertical location of the reflector. Furthermore, there may be errors in offsets, incident angles, and reflection amplitudes, in the analyses of the amplitude variation with offset (AVO). These GH effects might be more important for seismic data at fixed offsets and shallow layers, and for sonic log data, which might fall into the post-critical angle regime. Therefore, there may be a necessity to take into account the GH effect in the interpretation of wide-angle reflection data in NMO and AVO analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"The Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift and the Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shift are optical phenomena which describe the longitudinal and transverse lateral shifts at the reflection interface, respectively. Here, we predict the GH and IF shifts in Weyl semimetals (WSMs)-a promising material harboring low energy Weyl fermions, a massless fermionic cousin of photons. Our results show that the GH shift in WSMs is valley independent, which is analogous to that discovered in a 2D relativistic material-graphene. However, the IF shift has never been explored in nonoptical systems, and here we show that it is valley dependent. Furthermore, we find that the IF shift actually originates from the topological effect of the system. Experimentally, the topological IF shift can be utilized to characterize the Weyl semimetals, design valleytronic devices of high efficiency, and measure the Berry curvature.","Jiang, QD; Jiang, H; Liu, HW; Sun, QF; Xie, XC",22,47,PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS,Topological Imbert-Fedorov Shift in Weyl Semimetals,2015

"We show the utility of the weak value amplification to observe the quantum interference between two close lying atomic coherent states in a post-selected atomic cat state, produced in a system of N identical two-level atoms weakly interacting with a single photon field. Through the observation of the negative parts of the Wigner distribution of the post-selected atomic cat state, we find that the post-selected atomic cat state becomes more nonclassical when the post-selected polarization state of the single photon field tends toward becoming orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We show that the small phase shift in the post-selected atomic cat state can be amplified via measuring the peak shift of its phase distribution when the post-selected state of the single photon field is nearly orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We find that the amplification factor of 15 [5] can be obtained for a sample of 10 [100] atoms. This effectively provides us with a method to discriminate between two close lying states on the Bloch sphere. We discuss possible experimental implementation of the scheme, and conclude with a discussion of the Fisher information.","Huang, SM; Agarwal, GS",4,62,NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,Weak value amplification of atomic cat states,2015

"The behavior of the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts of the reflected and transmitted probe and signal pulses through a cavity containing four-level GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum wells with 15 periods of 17.5 nm GaAs wells and 15-nm Al0.3Ga0.7As barriers is theoretically discussed. The biexciton coherence set up by two coupling fields can induce the destructive interference to control the absorption and gain properties of probe field under appropriate conditions. It is realized that for the specific values of the intensities and the relative phase of applied fields, the simultaneous negative or positive GH shift in the transmitted and reflected light beam can be obtained via amplification in a probe light. It is found that by adjusting the controllable parameters, the GH shifts can be switched between the large positive and negative values in the medium. Moreover, the effect of exciton spin relaxation on the GH shift has also been discussed. We find that the exciton spin relaxation can manipulate the behavior of GH shift in the reflected and transmitted probe beam through the cavity. We show that by controlling the incident angles of probe beam and under certain conditions, the GH shifts in the reflected and transmitted probe beams can become either negative or positive corresponding to the superluminal or subluminal light propagation.

"We present a theoretical analysis of the lateral displacement (Goos-Hanchen shift) of spatially limited beams reflected from attenuated total reflection (ATR) devices in the Otto configuration when backward surface plasmon polaritons are excited at the interface between a positive refractive index slab and a semi-infinite metamaterial with a negative refractive index. First, the stationary phase approximation and a phenomenological model based on the properties of the complex poles and zeroes of the reflection coefficient are used to demonstrate that: (i) the excitation of backward surface waves can lead to both negative and positive (and not exclusively negative) Goos-Hanchen shifts, and (ii) the sign of the shift depends on whether the value of the coupling layer thickness is higher or lower than a critical value characteristic of the ATR structure. Then, these findings are verified through rigorous calculations of the spatial structure of the reflected beam. For incident beams with a Gaussian profile, the lateral shift calculated as the first moment of the field distribution of the reflected beam agrees quite well with the predictions of approximate analysis.

"We have explored the zero, positive and negative quantum Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts of the transmitted Dirac carriers in graphene through a potential barrier with vertical magnetic field. Numerical results show that only one energy position at the zero GH shift exists and is highly dependent on the y-directional wave vector, the energy gap, the magnetic field and the potential. The positive and negative GH shifts happen when the incident energy is more and less than the energy position at the zero GH shift, respectively. In addition, we found that there are two values of potential at the zero GH shifts, where a potential window can always keep the positive GH shifts.

"The Goos-Hanchen shift of the system composed by two cavity walls and an intracavity atomic sample is presented. The atomic sample is treated as a four-level double-Lambda system, driven by the two counterpropagating coupling fields. The probe field experiences the discontinuous refractive index variation and is reflected. Moreover, under the phase-matching condition, the four-wave mixing effect based on electromagnetically induced transparency can cause effective reflection. The Goos-Hanchen shifts appear in both situations and are carefully investigated in this article. We refer to the first one with the incident and reflected light having identical wavelength as the linear Goos-Hanchen shift, and the second one with the reflection wavelength determined by the phase-matching condition as the nonlinear Goos-Hanchen shift. The differences between the two kinds of shifts, such as the incident angle range, conditions for the shift peaks, and controllability, are discussed.","Zhang, XJ; Wang, HH; Liang, ZP; Xu, Y; Fan, CB; Liu, CZ; Gao, JY",4,51,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Goos-Hanchen shift in a standing-wave-coupled electromagnetically-induced-transparency medium,2015
"We consider a matter wave packet of cold atom gas impinging upon a step potential created by an optical light field. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the atomic eigenstates contain two types of evanescent states, one of which is an ordinary evanescent state with a pure imaginary wave vector while the other possesses a complex wave vector and is recognized as an oscillating evanescent state. We show that the presence and interplay of these two types of evanescent states can give rise to two different mechanisms for total internal reflection, and thus lead to an unusual Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect. As a result, not only large positive but also large negative GH shifts can be observed in the reflected atomic beam. The dependence of the GH shift on the incident angle, energy, and height of the step potential is studied numerically.","Zhou, L; Qin, JL; Lan, ZH; Dong, GJ; Zhang, WP",3,27,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Goos-Hanchen shifts in spin-orbit-coupled cold atoms,2015

"We present a design of a one dimensional dielectric waveguide that can trap a broadband light pulse with different frequency component stored at different positions, effectively forming a ""trapped rainbow"" [Nature 450, 397 (2007)]. The spectrum of the rainbow covers the whole visible range. To do this, we first show that the dispersion of a SiO2 waveguide with a Si grating placed on top can be engineered by the design parameter of the grating. Specifically, guided modes with zero group velocity(frozen modes) can be realized. Negative Goos-Hanchen shift along the surface of the grating is responsible for such a dispersion control. The frequency of the frozen mode is tuned by changing the lateral feature parameters (period and duty cycle) of the grating. By tuning the grating feature point by point along the waveguide, a light pulse can be trapped with different frequency components frozen at different positions, so that a ""rainbow"" is formed. The device is expected to have extremely low ohmic loss because only dielectric materials are used. A planar geometry also promises much reduced fabrication difficulty.

"Light reflection and refraction at an interface between two homogeneous media is analytically described by Snell's law. For a beam with a finite waist, it turns out that the reflected wave experiences a lateral displacement from its position predicted by geometric optics. Such Goos-Hanchen (G-H) effect has been extensively investigated among all kinds of optical media, such as dielectrics, metals, photonic crystals and metamaterials. As a fundamental physics phenomenon, the G-H effect has been extended to acoustics and quantum mechanics. Here we report the unusual G-H effect in zero index metamaterials. We show that when linearly polarized light is obliquely incident from air to epsilon-near-zero metamaterials, no G-H effect could be observed for p polarized light. While for s polarization, the G-H shift is a constant value for any incident angle.","Xu, YD; Chan, CT; Chen, HY",16,31,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,Goos-Hanchen effect in epsilon-near-zero metamaterials,2015
"The electromagnetic interaction of atoms with an evanescent light field is investigated with photon energy density and photon energy flux density using the Fresnel-Maxwell equations. The theory provides expressions of absorption signal intensities in attenuated total reflection spectroscopy for the p- and s-polarizations of the incident light, and relates them to the Goos-Hanchen shift. For an electric dipole interaction, the energy stored in the electric field of an evanescent light governs the absorption process, and hence the photon energy density and the photon energy flux density should be estimated from the energy stored in the electric field. The violation of equality between the portions of the energy stored respectively in the electric and magnetic fields yields the difference of the absorption signal intensity and its dependence on the incident angle between the s- and p-polarizations.

"The interference between optical beams of different polarizations plays a fundamental role in reproducing the optical analog of the electron spin weak measurement. The extraordinary point in optical weak measurements is represented by the possibility of estimating with great accuracy the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift by measuring the distance between the peaks of the outgoing beams for two opposite rotation angles of the polarizers located before and after the dielectric block. Starting from the numerical calculation of the GH shift, which clearly shows a frequency crossover for incidence near the critical angle, we present a detailed study of the interference between s and p polarized waves in the critical region. This makes it possible to determine in which conditions axial deformations can be avoided and the GH curves reproduced. In view of a possible experimental implementation, we give the expected weak measurement curves for Gaussian lasers of different beam waist sizes propagating through borosilicate (BK7) and fused silica dielectric blocks.","Araujo, MP; De Leo, S; Maia, GG",4,37,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,Axial dependence of optical weak measurements in the critical region,2015

"The electronic structure of a single-layer graphene with a periodic Fermi velocity modulation is investigated by using an effective Dirac-like Hamiltonian. In a gapless graphene or in a graphene with a constant energy gap the modulation of the Fermi velocity, as expected, only changes the dispersion between energy and moment, turning the minibands narrower or less narrow than in the usual graphene depending on how the Fermi velocity is modulated and the energy gap remains the same. However, with a modulated energy gap it is possible to control the energy gap of graphene by Fermi velocity engineering. This is based on a very simple idea that has never been reported so far.

"The negative and positive Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts in reflected light are revisited for a partial coherent light incident on a cavity. A three-level dilute gaseous atomic medium, which follows two-photon Raman transitions, is considered in a cavity. The anomalous (negative group index) and normal (positive group index) dispersions of the intracavity medium lead to negative and positive GH shifts, respectively. The effects of beam width, spatial coherence, and mode index of partial coherent light fields are studied on the negative and positive GH shifts. It is observed that the amplitude of negative and positive GH shifts are relatively large for a small range of beam width and for a small value of spatial coherence of partial coherent light beams. The amplitude of GH shifts becomes small for large beam width and spatial coherence of incident light. Further, the distortion in the reflected light field increases when the amplitude of the GH shifts increases and vice versa.","Ziauddin; Chuang, YL; Lee, RK",5,33,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Negative and positive Goos-Hanchen shifts of partially coherent light fields,2015

The shape transformations of the wave packet illuminating periodic and quasiperiodic apodized Bragg reflectors have been under consideration. Spatial apodization of permittivity contrast yields much smaller shape deformation of the transmitted wave packet upon incidence at angles and carrier frequency near the edges of reflection band, as well in Bragg reflection band, in comparison with phenomena in similar periodic structures.

"For magnon spintronic applications, the detailed knowledge of spin wave (SW) beam dispersion, transmission (reflection) of SWs passing through (reflected from) interfaces, or borders or the scattering of SWs by inhomogeneities is crucial. These wave properties are decisive factors on the usefulness of a particular device.

We show that this effect will exist for a broad range of frequencies in the dipole-exchange range, with the magnetization degree of pinning at the film edge as the crucial parameter, whatever its nature. Moreover, we have also found that the GH effect can be accompanied or even dominating by a bending of the SW beam due to the inhomogeneity of the internal magnetic field. This inhomogeneity, created by demagnetizing field taking place at the film edge, causes gradual change of SWs refractive index. The refraction of the SW beams by the non-uniformity of the magnetic field enables the exploration of graded index magnonics and metamaterial properties for the transmission and processing of information at nanoscale.

"We propose a method of realizing an effective electron spin beam splitter in graphene through the Goos-Hanchen effect. The device consists of a layer of monolayer graphene on which two ferromagnetic stripes are deposited with parallel or antiparallel magnetization configuration. It is shown that the transmitted spin-up and spin-down electron beams are found at different longitudinal positions and their spatial separation can be enhanced by the number of transmission resonances formed between the two ferromagnetic stripes. The spatial separation between the spin-up and spin-down electron beams can reach values up to hundreds of wavelengths, which can be observed experimentally.

"We study the manipulation of Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts for the reflected and transmitted probe light pulses injected into a cavity containing four-level configuration mercury atoms where the probe transition is in the ultraviolet (UV) region with a wavelength of 253.7 nm. Different behaviors of the GH shifts can be observed in the absence, or presence, of two driving fields as well as an incoherent pump field. When neither coherent driving fields nor incoherent pumping is turned on, we realize negative reflected GH shifts for anomalous dispersion. Including only one driving field leads to subluminal-based light propagation with positive lateral shifts at certain incident angles. Taking into account the impact of both driving fields, negative GH shifts reappear in the reflected part of the incident light. The origin of this defect is attributed to interacting double dark resonances due to a high-resolution absorption peaks with a very steep negative slope of dispersion in the susceptibility profile. We then show that one can surpass this defect by applying a weak incoherent pumping field to obtain positive GH shifts for both reflected and transmitted light beams. Finally, using the 6 P-1(1) <-> 6 S-1(0) transition of Hg, we generalize our study to the case where the wavelength of the probe transition is 185 nm which is in the vacuum-ultraviolet domain. Although the number of oscillations is now increased, however, similar results are reported with respect to the case of UV transition.","Hamedi, HR; Radmehr, A; Sahrai, M",20,71,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Manipulation of Goos-Hanchen shifts in the atomic configuration of mercury via interacting dark-state resonances,2014
"Recent studies on surface reflection illustrate how light beams can be laterally shifted from the position predicted by geometrical optics, the so called Goos-Hanchen effect. In antiferromagnets this shifts can be controlled with an external magnetic field. We show that a configuration in which spins cant in response to applied magnetic fields enhance possibilities of field controlled shifts. Moreover, we show that nonreciprocal displacements are possible, for both oblique and normal incidence, due to inherent nonreciprocity of the polariton phase with respect to the propagation direction. In the absence of an external field, reciprocal displacements occur.

"We report a theoretical study of the enhanced Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect in a prism-waveguide coupling system with a magneto-optic thin film of Ce doped Y3Fe5O12 (CeYIG). By magnetizing the CeYIG thin film along different directions, a variation of the GH shift can be observed, which is named as the MOGH (magneto-optical Goos-Hanchen) effect. The applied magnetic field direction is found to cause MOGH effect for light with different polarizations. As example systems, enhanced GH shift and MOGH effect is observed in both prism/Air/CeYIG/SiO2 and prism/Au/CeYIG/SiO2 structures, by applying opposite magnetic field across the CeYIG layer in a transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) configuration. The GH and MOGH effect as a function of layer thicknesses, material refractive indices and magneto-optical properties are systematically simulated and discussed. It is observed that the coupling layer and MO layer thickness plays an important role of controlling the MOGH effect in the prism/Au/CeYIG/SiO2 plasmonic waveguide structure.

"The frustrated total internal reflection theories (FTIR) from previous century are thoroughly recalculated from the, so called, monodromy operator's point of view - a theory lunched by Born and Wolf [Principles of Optics (Pergamon Press, 1975), Chap. 1.6] and Arnold [Geometric Methods in the Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations (Springer, 1987)]. Monodromy is a theory of simultaneous solution (for both reflection and transmission amplitudes) of one dimensional Schrodinger equation (for the wavefunction and its derivative) and the Maxwell equation (for electric and magnetic fields). Introducing new quantities: the dwell distance and the phase distance, we get general Goos-Hanchen (G-H) shift formula for optical tunneling for three layer system with refraction indexes n(0), n(1), n(2).

Our results show that a focused light source undergoes significant lateral shift when the polarization of incident light changes from transverse magnetic (TM) to transverse electric (TE) mode, indicating a large G-H shift in graphene that is polarization-dependent.

"Ray optics is a useful tool even in the regime where, actually, full wave calculations would be appropriate. However, wave-inspired adjustments are needed to ensure the accuracy of ray-based predictions. Here, we investigate these semiclassical corrections to the ray picture -the Goos-Hanchen shift and the Fresnel filtering effect- for the reflection of light beams at curved, rather than planar, interfaces. We present analytical and numerical results that highlight the role of boundary curvature and show clear deviations from the planar case. The Goos-Hanchen shift is decreased at convexely curved interfaces present in optical microcavities and microlasers compared to the planar case, and increased for concave curvature. In contrast, the Fresnel filtering effect is increased by both kinds of curvature. For a straightforward explanation of these findings we introduce an intuitive picture that explicitly takes curvature into account and that allows for a qualitative understanding of the beam shift behaviour.

"C-lines in vector electromagnetic waves are analogues of the more familiar optical vortices found in the complex scalar waves usually used to describe light. The centroid of a laser beam is shifted on reflection by the well-known Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects, but if it carries a C-line two separate C-lines appear in the reflected beam, both of which are shifted, their shifts being unrelated to the well-known shift of the beam centroid. An experiment is described that tests the theoretical predictions for the shifts of the C-lines perpendicular to the plane of incidence. It used internal reflection in a glass prism close to the critical angle to enhance the effect. In a simple situation like this, two recently published independent theories of C-line reflection are both applicable and it is shown that their predictions are identical. Our measured differences in the shifts of the two reflected C-lines confirm both theories. Remarkably, the measurable C-line shifts are much larger (hundreds of micrometers) than traditional beam-shift displacements. Theoretically, the difference is infinite at the critical angle itself with a change of sign.","Loffler, W; Nye, JF; Hannay, JH",1,21,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,An experiment on the shifts of reflected C-lines,2014

"A negative Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift of light beam reflecting from planar microphotonic structures consisting of two parallel dielectric subwavelength diffraction gratings is predicted. The phenomenon occurs because the energy flow of the mode guided in the subwavelength structure is predominantly directed in the opposite direction to the energy flow of the incident beam. The numerical calculations show that the negative GH shift can reach approximately six times that of the wavelength in realistic structures, so that the phenomenon can be experimentally observed. In addition to the negative lateral shift, the focusing of the beam in reflection from the grating is also observed as a secondary effect.

Results show that lateral shifts can be either positive or negative dependent on the incident angle and the atomic internal state. Interestingly, a giant lateral shift of transmitted wave with high transmission probability is observed, which is helpful to observe such lateral shifts experimentally.

"Spin-dependent splitting of the reflected beam for the chiral metamaterial slab is investigated by analyzing the spatial transverse shifts (TSs) of the two spin-dependent components of the reflected beam. Two components refer to the right-circularly polarized and left-circularly polarized reflected wave components. The influences of the physical parameters and the polarization of the incident beam on the spin-dependent splitting are discussed. The results show that two components are asymmetric due to the cross-polarization of the electromagnetic fields in chiral slab. By adjusting the angle of incidence and the polarization state of the incident beam, the spatial splitting can be enhanced. Moreover, the effect of the thickness on the spatial TSs of the two components becomes weak with increasing the angle of incidence. To one's interest, the spin-dependent splitting also can be realized for two special linear (TE and TM) polarization.

"We show how careful control of the incident polarization of a light beam close to the Brewster angle gives a giant transverse spatial shift on reflection. This resolves the long-standing puzzle of why such beam shifts transverse to the incident plane (Imbert-Fedorov shifts) tend to be an order of magnitude smaller than the related Goos-H nchen shifts in the longitudinal direction, which are largest close to critical incidence. We demonstrate that with the proper initial polarization the transverse displacements can be equally large, which we confirm experimentally near Brewster incidence. In contrast to the established understanding, these polarizations are elliptical and angle dependent. We explain the magnitude of the Imbert-Fedorov shift by an analogous change of the symmetry properties for the reflection operators as compared to the Goos-H nchen shift.","Gotte, JB; Loffler, W; Dennis, MR",18,32,PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS,Eigenpolarizations for Giant Transverse Optical Beam Shifts,2014

Explicit formulas of the GH shifts are derived and analyzed at three particular angles of incidence: critical angle, pseudo-Brewster angle, and grazing incidence, near which the reflection phases exhibit strong variations and large GH shifts are likely to occur. The damping in the anisotropic metamaterials may result in GH shifts not available in ordinary isotropic media. In particular, a larger GH shift can be associated with a larger rather than a smaller damping, and a small change of damping may even reverse the direction of the GH shift near the pseudo-Brewster angle. This feature is characterized by a parabolic relation determined by the complex components of the permittivity tensor.

The efficiency of such lenses becomes even more prominent for miniature systems application where light absorption has negligible effect compared with the reflection losses at the interfaces. However, at such scales, the effect of Goos-Hanchen shift that associates the TIR should be accounted for in order to design a proper surface profile of the TIR lenses.

We report the existence of nonstandard nonlinear GHSs displaying an extreme sensitivity to the input intensity and the existence of multiple critical values. These intermittent and oscillatory regimes can be explained in terms of competition between critical coupling to a surface mode and soliton emission from the refracted beam component and how this interplay varies with localization of the initial Airy beam.

"The transmission and Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift for charge carriers in gate-controllable ferromagnetic graphene induced by ferromagnetic insulator are investigated theoretically. Numerical results demonstrate that spin-up and spin-down electrons exhibit remarkably different transmission and GH shifts. The spin-dependent GH shifts directly demonstrate the spin beam splitting effect, which can be controlled by the voltage agate. We attribute the spin beam splitting effect to the combination of tunneling through potential barrier and Zeeman interaction from the magnetic field and the exchange proximity interaction between the ferromagnetic insulator and graphene.

"We study the quantum Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift and the tunneling transmission at a curved step potential by investigating the time evolution of a wave packet. An initial wave packet is expanded in terms of the eigenmodes of a circular step potential. Its time evolution is then given by the interference of their simple eigenmode oscillations. We show that the GH shift along the step boundary can be explained by the energy-dependent phase loss upon reflection, which is defined by modifying the one-dimensional (1D) effective potential derived from the two-dimensional (2D) circular system. We also demonstrate that the tunneling transmission of the wave packet is characterized by a free-space image distant from the boundary. The tunneling transmission exhibits a rather wide angle divergence and the direction of maximum tunneling is slightly rotated from the tangent at the incident point, which is consistent with the time delay of the tunneling wave packet computed in the 1D modified effective potential.","Lee, SY; Le Deunff, J; Choi, M; Ketzmerick, R",6,30,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Quantum Goos-Hanchen shift and tunneling transmission at a curved step potential,2014

"Based no the classical spiraling photon model proposed by Hongrui Li, the laws of reflection, refraction of a single photon can be derived. Moreover, the polarization, total reflection, evanescent wave and Goos-Hanchen shift of a single photon can be elucidated. However, this photon model is still unfinished. Especially, the spiraling diameter of a photon is not definite. In this paper, the continuous research works on this new theory are reported. According to the facts that the diffraction limit of light and the smallest diameter of the focal spot of lenses are all equal to the wavelength. of the light, we can get that the spiraling diameter of a photon equals to the wavelength., so we gain that the angle between the linear velocity of the spiraling photon. and the component of the linear velocity in the forward direction.b is 45 degrees, and the energy of a classical spiraling photon E = ( 1/ 2) mv(2) = ( 1/ 2) m2c(2) = mc(2). This coincides with Einstein's mass-energy relation. While it is obtained that the velocity of the evanescent wave in the vacuum is slower than the velocity of light in glass in straight line. In such a way, the optical fiber can slow the light down. In addition, the force analysis of a single photon in optical tweezers system is discussed. And the reason that the laser beam can capture the particle slightly downstream from the focal point can be explained.","Li, HR",1,15,NANOPHOTONICS AND MICRO/NANO OPTICS II,Continuing research on the classical spiraling photon model,2014
"The Goos-Hanchen shifts of the reflected beam from graphene-on-dielectric (or metal) in the optical wavelength are investigated by using the stationary-phase method. For the graphene-on-dielectric substrates, it is found that the pseudo-Brewster angle and Goos-Hanchen shift are influenced greatly by the introduced graphene sheets for TM polarization. By changing number of graphene sheets, the lateral shifts can be large positive or negative near the pseudo-Brewster angle. For TE polarization, the lateral shift is still small; however it can also be positive or negative by changing the number of graphene sheets. For the graphene-on-metal substrates, graphene sheets exert a great impact on the reflectance while has little effect on the lateral shifts of both polarizations.

"We present here tunable and reconfigurable designs of linear and nonlinear plasmonic and hyperbolic metamaterials. Rich scattering features of multilayered composite nanoparticles are demonstrated, which include complex and exotic scattering signatures combining multiple dipolar Fano resonances and electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT) features. These dipole-dipole multi-Fano scattering responses can be further tuned through altering the plasmonic properties of the concentric layers or the permittivity of the core, for instance, by the presence of nonlinearities. Strong third-order nonlinear effects, such as optical bistability, may also be induced in the scattering response of nonlinear nanoparticles due to the highly enhanced and confined fields inside their core. Nonlinear hyperbolic metamaterial designs are also explored, which can realize tunable positive-to-negative refraction at the same frequency, as a function of the input intensity. Negative Goos-Hanchen shift is demonstrated based only on the hyperbolic dispersion properties of these layered metamaterials without the usual need of negative index metamaterials. The Goos-Hanchen shift may be tuned from positive-to-negative values, when the structure is illuminated with different frequencies.

"There is a long-standing debate surrounding whether or not enhanced total internal reflection (ETIR) is possible. ETIR implies that the magnitude of the reflection coefficient is greater than unity and is conjectured to be possible when a field is incident from a lossless material to a gainy material beyond the critical angle. In this letter, we examine this problem through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling. The two-dimensional simulations employ a Gaussian incident beam and make no a priori assumptions about the reflection coefficient. We consider illumination of gainy, lossless, and lossy materials. The Poynting vector is used to examine the flow of energy. For a gainy material, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient is found to be greater than unity, but there is a delay between when energy enters the gainy material and when the ""excess"" energy is reflected from the interface. Thus, given the Goos-Hanchen shift associated with total internal reflection, where the reflected beam is shifted relative to the incident beam (so that fields must travel in the gainy material before being reflected), the existence of ETIR appears not only to be plausible, but to be inevitable.","Chen, Z; Schneider, JB; Willis, K; Hagness, SC",0,17,IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS,A Time-Domain Analysis of Enhanced Total Internal Reflection Using the FDTD Method,2014

The intracavity medium exhibits a Raman gain process which is accompanied by anomalous dispersion, i.e., superluminal pulse propagation (Dogariu et al 2000 Nature 406 277). In the presence of a Kerr field, the gain-dispersion properties of the intracavity medium are modified, which leads to enhancement in the positive and negative group indices of the medium. The behavior of the GH shift in the reflected light due to the enhancement in the group indices in the presence of the Kerr field is investigated, and relatively large positive and negative GH shifts can be obtained.","Abbas, M; Ziauddin; Qamar, S",20,49,LASER PHYSICS LETTERS,Amplitude control of the Goos-Hanchen shift via a Kerr nonlinearity,2014
"We show under which conditions optical Gaussian beams, propagating throughout an homogeneous dielectric right angle prism, present an asymmetric Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect. This asymmetric behavior is seen for incidence at critical angles and happens in the propagation direction of the outgoing beam. The asymmetric GH effect can also be seen as an amplification of the standard GH shift. Due to the fact that it only depends on the ratio between the wavelength and the minimal waist size of the incoming Gaussian beam, it can also be used to determine one of these parameters. Multiple-peak interference is an additional phenomenon seen in the presence of such asymmetric effects.","Araujo, MP; Carvalho, SA; De Leo, S",6,25,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,The asymmetric Goos-Hanchen effect,2014
"When guided wave resonance occurs on the prism-waveguide coupling system (PWCS), the reflected beam undergoes angular shift which contributes to lateral shift of the reflected beam, in addition to the Goos-Hanchen (GH) lateral shift. We investigate the net lateral shift of the reflected beam at the Rayleigh range where the beam waist does not broaden obviously. It is shown that the incident angle associated with the maximum net lateral shift deviates from the resonant angle and the maximum net lateral shift is larger than GH shift. And at the same time, the net lateral shift is more sensitive than GH shift to the changes of PWCS parameters.

"The time delay, space shift and widening of wave packet transmitted and reflected by structures with Bragg mirrors have been investigated. The specific structures such as Bragg mirrors, resonators, and structures with chirp variation of thickness of the ""period"" have been considered. The calculation has been carried out under the conditions that carrier frequency and incidence angle is in the vicinity of the Bragg resonance.

The conditions for the appearance of anomalous (negative) mass center delay or mass center shift (Goos-Hanchen shift) of the reflected wave packet have been determined. The shape transformations of the wave packet illuminating periodic and quasiperiodic apodized Bragg reflectors have been under consideration. Spatial apodization of permittivity contrast yields much smaller shape deformation of the transmitted wave packet upon incidence at angles and carrier frequency near the edges of reflection band, as well in Bragg reflection band, in comparison with phenomena in similar periodic structures.

"In a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguide corner mirror (WCM) structure, with the quantum process of a frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) phenomenon and the time delay principle in the two-dimensional potential barrier tunneling process of a mass of particles, we derive an accurate physical model for the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift of optical guided-mode in the FTIR process, and in principle match the GH shift jumping states with the independent guided-modes. Then, we propose and demonstrate a new regime of 1 x N digital optical switches with a matching state between the free-carrier dispersion (FCD) based refractive index modulation (RIM) of silicon to create a GH shift jumping function of a photonic signal at the reflecting interface and the independent guided-modes in the FTIR process, where a MOS-capacitor type electro-optic modulation regime is proposed and discussed to realize an effective FCD-based RIM. At the critical matching state, i.e., the incident of an optical beam is at the vicinity of Brewster angle in the WCM, a mini-change of refractive index of waveguide material can cause a great jump of GH shift along the FTIR reflecting interface, and further a 1 x N digital optical switching process could be realized.

"Intrinsic properties of surface plasmons (SPs) excited with Kretschmann configuration were analyzed as a function of wavelength, including the propagation length, the penetration depth, the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift, and the field enhancement. The calculated results indicate that there exists a critical thickness (t (cr)) of the gold layer and that the maximum GH shift occurring exactly at the SP resonance wavelength (lambda (R)) rapidly varies from positive to negative with changing of the gold layer thickness from t < t (cr) to t > t (cr). The maximum field enhancement happens not at lambda (R) but at a wavelength smaller than lambda (R) due to the phase retardation between the transmitted and reflected light. Simulations also reveal that a broadband collimated near-infrared beam can simultaneously excite two SPs with different responses to a refractive index (RI) change: the shorter-wavelength SP able to make a small redshift and the longer-wavelength SP capable of yielding a large blueshift. Only the shorter-wavelength SP was experimentally observed and its RI sensitivity was measured to increase from 3,539 nm/RIU at lambda (R) = 707.6 nm to 57,143 nm/RIU at lambda (R) = 1,398 nm. The SP at lambda (R) = 1,013 nm moved to lambda (R) = 1,029 nm in response to the saturation adsorption of bovine serum albumin, and the corresponding surface coverage was determined to be I"" = 1.565 ng/mm(2) based on a quasilinear dependence of I"" on the resonance wavelength shift (a dagger lambda (R)) deduced theoretically.

Resonant transmission and Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift for Dirac fermion beams tunneling through graphene double velocity barrier structures (DVBs) are investigated theoretically. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that strong resonant tunneling effect occurs in this structure and is highly dependent on the incident angle and the structure of velocity barriers. The resonant tunneling in graphene DVBs belongs to the Fabry-Perot resonance and leads to oscillated conduction at wide energy range. It is also found that GH shifts in this structure can be enhanced by the resonant tunneling and multi-GH shift peaks with giant magnitudes can occur at these resonant energy positions. These special properties of GH shifts in graphene DVBs may have good application in lateral manipulation of electron beams and valley or spin beam splitter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

At the edge of the transmission gap, the Goos-Hanchen shifts of electrons have strong peaks and are tuned by the structure parameters. Furthermore, for the real magnetic structure induced by ferromagnetic strips, the transmission gap and GH shift remain.

"We study the Imbert Fedorov (IF) shifts of a reflected Gaussian beam from uniaxially anisotropic chiral media (UACM), where the chirality appears only in one direction and the host medium is a uniaxial crystal or an electric plasma. The numerical results are presented for three kinds of UACM, respectively. It is found that the IF shifts are closely related to the propagation properties of the two eigenwaves in the UACM. In general, when either of the eigenwaves is totally reflected, the IF shifts can change abruptly near the critical angle. The cross-polarized reflection coefficient has a greater effect on the spatial IF (SIF) shift than on the angular IF (AIF) shift, and the sign of the AIF shift depends mainly on that of the difference between the co-polarized reflectivity.

"We study the quantum Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect for wave-packet dynamics at a normal/superconductor (NS) interface. We find that the effect is amplified by a factor (E-F/Delta), with E-F the Fermi energy and Delta the gap. Interestingly, the GH effect appears only as a time delay delta t without any lateral shift, and the corresponding delay length is about (E-F/Delta)lambda(F), with lambda(F) the Fermi wavelength. This makes the NS interface ""sticky"" when Delta << E-F, since typically GH effects are of wavelength order. This ""sticky"" behavior can be further enhanced by a resonance mode in the NSNS interface.

"A photon model is proposed, and the parameter equations of the photon are obtained. This model can explain the polarization, total reflection, evanescent wave, and Goos-Hanchen shift of a single photon. The evanescent waves of photons with different frequencies are refractively dispersed. The Goos-Hanchen shift is dependent on the difference between the two refractive indices of media, the incident angle, and the frequency of the photon. According to this model, an evanescent wave of light does not decay exponentially along the z direction and does not propagate along the x direction infinitely. The laws of refraction and reflection for a single photon can be derived. The refractive dispersion of light can be explained. According to this model, every photon is polarized. Polarization is the intrinsic nature of the photon. The motion of a single photon is either clockwise or counterclockwise. The so-called unpolarized light refers to light that consists of an equal number of photons with clockwise motion and counterclockwise motion. The trajectories of two photons with the same frequency but opposite spiral directions are mirror-image isomers. They cannot be superimposed upon each other. (C) The Authors.

"We present a theoretical study on the nonlocal optical effects on the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift of reflected light from a composite material of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs). Using different nonlocal effective medium models, it is observed that such effects can be significant for small MNP of sizes down to a few nanometers. For small metallic volume fractions, the composite behaves like dielectric and the nonlocal effects lead to significant different Brewster angles, at which large negative GH shifts take place. For larger volume fractions or shorter wavelengths, the composite behaves more like metals and the nonlocal effects also lead to different Brewster angles but at values close to grazing incidence. These results will have significant implications in the application of different effective medium models for the characterization of these nanometallic composites when the MNPs are down to a few nanometers in size.

The results show that for a definite value of loss and for values larger than that, backward surface waves which lead to negative lateral GH shifts can be excited.

"We investigate the behavior of full-vector electromagnetic Bessel beams obliquely incident at an interface between two electrically different media. We employ a Fourier transform domain representation of Bessel beams to determine their behavior upon reflection and transmission. This transform, which is geometric in nature, consists of elliptical support curves with complex weighting associated with them. The behavior of the scattered field at an interface is highly complex, owing to its full-vector nature; nevertheless, this behavior has a straightforward representation in the transform domain geometry. The analysis shows that the reflected field forms a different vector Bessel beam, but in general, the transmitted field cannot be represented as a Bessel beam. Nevertheless, using this approach, we demonstrate a method to propagate a Bessel beam in the refractive medium by launching a non-Bessel beam at the interface. Several interesting phenomena related to the behavior of Bessel beams are illustrated, such as polarized reflection at Brewster's angle incidence, and the Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Federov shifts in the case of total reflection.

"We study the Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shifts of a reflected Gaussian beam from anisotropic topological insulators (TIs). Aiming, respectively, at the two types of TI surface perturbations that can alter the surface optical properties, i.e., a magnetic coating and an applied magnetic field, we discuss the dependences of the IF shifts on the axion field, the TI's extent of anisotropy, the angle of incidence and the applied magnetic field. For a left-elliptically polarized incident beam, a positive (negative) axion field can lead to the decrease (increase) of the IF shifts relative to a conventional insulator in the magnetic coating case, and in the applied magnetic field case, the crossover of the IF shifts between the positive and the negative values can be realized by adjusting some external parameters. Also, the properties of the IF shifts are discussed for linearly and circularly-polarized incident beams. The results show that TI might be a desirable candidate for controlling flexibly the IF shifts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

At critical angles, such a shift is instead proportional to the square root of the product of the beam waist and wavelength.

"On scattering, the high strength singularity of a vortex beam breaks into a configuration of single charge vortices. The precise geometry of such a vortex constellation depends on the angle of incidence and the material properties of the scatterer, but also on the optical spin-orbit coupling as choosing different input and output polarization results in a family of vortex constellation. Measuring the position of the individual vortices allows us to reconstruct elements in an systematic expansion of the scattering matrix, in an analogy to optical aberration theory.

"Due to their very high integration density, echelle grating spectrometers based on silicon nanophotonic platforms have received great attention for their applications in many areas, such as optical sensors, optical communications, and optical interconnections. The design of echelle gratings requires an effective modeling and simulation technique. Though we have used a boundary integral method to accurately analyze the polarization-dependent performance of the echelle grating, it is complicated and time-consuming for the simulation due to its large size and aperiodic structure. In the present paper, we will present a faster simulation method for the grating with twice total internal reflection facets based on a modified Kirchhoff-Huygens principle with the influence of the Goos-Hanchen shift considered. On the one hand, the presented simulation results agree well with our previous results obtained by the boundary integral method when the shift can accurately be calculated using a FDTD method. On the other hand, the biggest advantage of the new method over the existing methods is that it can also provide an insightful physical explanation for many numerical results. Finally, we will effectively apply the present method to design an on-chip spectrometer with very low noise floor.","Song, J; Chen, LC; Li, BJ",3,29,PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER,A FAST SIMULATION METHOD OF SILICON NANOPHOTONIC ECHELLE GRATINGS AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN THE DESIGN OF ON-CHIP SPECTROMETERS,2013

"A detailed study on Goos-Hanchen (GH) lateral displacements of the reflected and transmitted waves propagating at the interface between an isotropic medium and a gyroelectric medium in Voigt configuration is presented. After the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient are derived, based on the stationary phase approach, GH lateral displacements are obtained analytically. The numerical results for a specific gyroelectric medium are also given. It shows that with the existence of an applied magnetic field, the GH effect occurs not only during total reflection but also during nontotal reflection, which is not true for isotropic media. Moreover, due to the nonreciprocal property of the gyroelectric medium, the sign of the incident angle also influences the displacements.

The field transformations taking into account a finite beam width are described based on the plane-wave representation and geometric rotations. Using geometrical-optics coordinate frames accompanying the beams, we construct an effective Jones matrix characterizing spatial-dispersion properties of the interface. This results in a unified self-consistent description of the Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts (the latter being also known as the spin Hall effect of light). Our description reveals the intimate relation of the transverse Imbert-Fedorov shift to the geometric phases between constituent waves in the beam spectrum and to the angular momentum conservation for the whole beam.

We consider explicitly the partial reflection analogue and the in-plane polarized analogue to Wolter's example, as well as a pair of plane waves propagating slightly out of their mutual plane of incidence, revealing the transverse, Imbert-Fedorov shift. We find these simple cases have a complicated polarization structure, with a range of polarization singularities and complex orbital and spin current flows, generalizing Wolter's discovery of an optical vortex and circulating energy flow at the heart of the net scalar interference pattern.","Dennis, MR; Gotte, JB",11,36,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,Beam shifts for pairs of plane waves,2013
"The process of reflection and transmission of a paraxial wavepacket at a plane interface of two isotropic transparent media is considered. The transverse force (TF), i.e., the force perpendicular to the plane of incidence, exerted by the medium on the field in the course of this process is investigated. It is shown that the TF under investigation can be identified as the reverse Abraham TF. The relations between this force and the transverse shifts (TSs) of the centers of gravity of the reflected and transmitted light beams are established. It is argued that the detection of linear and angular TSs means the determination of the respective TFs. On the basis of the aforementioned relations, the analytical expression for the TF associated with the linear TSs has been obtained, which shows that this TF is a fundamental feature of the transformation of the beam's intrinsic angular momentum at the interface.","Fedoseyev, VG",3,51,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,Transverse forces related to the transverse shifts of reflected and transmitted light beams,2013

These quasi-two-dimensional systems, where light confinement is due to total internal reflection, are characterized by a curved dielectric interface. Deformation causes the curvature to vary along the system boundary, which directly affects the curvature-dependent Goos-Hanchen shift and consequently the ray dynamics in the microcavity. We discuss the resulting modifications in the far-field characteristics as a function of wavenumber and radius of curvature by means of a concrete example.","Kotik, D; Hentschel, M",3,30,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,How curvature affects the far-field emission from deformed optical microcavities,2013

As a result we find that, in the first case, the shifts are independent of OAM and beam focusing, while in the second case, modifications in the OAM spectrum occur which depend on the input OAM mode as well as on the beam focusing. This is investigated by experiment and theory. We also show how the two methods, beam shifts on the one hand, and OAM spectrum changes on the other, are related theoretically.","Loffler, W; Hermosa, N; Aiello, A; Woerdman, JP",2,19,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,Total internal reflection of orbital angular momentum beams,2013

This is done under the assumption that the detector time is longer than the temporal length of the wavepacket (wavepacket regime).

"The influence of polarization of a light beam on its geometrical characteristics at propagation in a two-dimensional isotropic graded-index medium using the methods of coherent states is investigated. In a paraxial approximation taking into account the second order terms in a vector wave equation, the expressions for the trajectory and width of linearly and circularly polarized radiation are obtained. It is shown that the circular polarization leads to the rotation of the propagation plane of the meridional rays and additional rotation of sagittal rays, depending on the axial shift of the incident beam. Both circular and linear polarizations result in oscillations of the width of a light beam propagating in a graded-index fiber. In the case of linearly polarized light, the initially symmetric beam becomes elliptical with broadening in the direction of the polarization plane. Beam shifts or corrections with respect to geometrical optics caused by the scalar (nonparaxiality) and vector (polarization) wave effects are investigated.","Petrov, NI",1,27,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,Beam shift in a graded-index optical fiber,2013

"A reflection-type space-division optical switch is theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on the electrically tuned Goos-Hanchen effect in a symmetrical metal-cladding waveguide which employs the PMN-PT ceramics as the guiding layer. Owing to the high sensitivity of the ultrahigh-order modes, the variation of refractive index and thickness induced by the exertion of the controlled voltage on the PMN-PT ceramics will easily give rise to a change in the position of the reflected light. In the experiment, a three-pinhole array is put in the reflected light path and a one-to-three optical switch is achieved. The switching time for 10%-90% light intensity change and the optical crosstalk are measured to be lower than 1.63 mu s and -29 dB, respectively.

Both of these two peaks are affected by variations of layers' doping densities. Furthermore, at increased incident angles of incoming EM waves, the dwell time peak occurs at the upper boundary of the frequency interval, for which the structure exhibits negative refractive index.","Radovanovic, J; Ilic, I; Belicev, PP; Milanovic, V; Hadzievski, L",1,38,APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING,Comparison of tunneling times in isotropic and anisotropic media,2012

Strong spatial dispersion ability is exhibited at the guided-mode resonance, which leads to a rapid changing of the reflected beam shift with respect to the light wavelength. It is demonstrated to be an effective way to enlarge the lateral shift of the reflected beam by increasing the guiding layer thickness, which helps to improve the sensitivity of the wavelength-shift monitoring.

"For total reflection of a pulsed light beam at the interface between vacuum and a negative permittivity medium, the electromagnetic fields and the associated energy-flux patterns in the two media are investigated analytically and numerically. For a TE (transverse electric) polarized pulsed beam with positive Goos-Hanchen shift, energy reflection occurs not only in the second medium but also in the first medium because of interference between the incident and reflected fields. However, for TM (transverse magnetic) polarization where the Goos-Hanchen shift is negative, reflection of energy flux occurs in the first medium (or in front of the interface). At the same time, the energy flux around the interface forms time-dependent loops which absorb energy from the incoming flux in the front edge of the pulse but release energy into the outgoing flux in the later edge of the pulse to ensure energy conservation. Therefore, the so-called causality paradox in TM polarization is caused by the fact that interference between incident and reflected fields in the first medium and energy-flux loops around the interface offer a shorter path for reflection of energy flux (or photons).","Liu, XM; Yang, QF; Zhu, PF; Zhang, YL; Shi, Y",0,32,JOURNAL OF OPTICS,The time-dependent energy-flux pattern in total reflection of a pulsed light beam,2012

GH shifts for spin electron beams across this type of MB nanostructures, is derived exactly, with the help of the stationary phase method. It is shown that GH shifts depend strongly on the spin directions for double delta-MBs with unidentical magnetic strengths, giving rise to a considerable spin polarization effect. It also is shown that spin polarization of GH shifts is closely relative to the separation and magnetic-strength difference of two delta-MBs.

"The simple reflection of a light beam of finite transverse extent from a homogeneous interface gives rise to a surprisingly large number of subtle shifts and deflections which can be seen as diffractive corrections to the laws of geometrical optics (Goos-Hanchen shifts) and manifestations of optical spin-orbit coupling (Imbert-Fedorov shifts), related to the spin Hall effect of light. We develop a unified linear algebra approach to dielectric reflection which allows for a simple calculation of all these effects and lends itself to an interpretation of beam shifts as weak values in a classical analogue to a quantum weak measurement. We present a systematic study of the shifts for the whole beam and its polarization components, finding symmetries between input and output polarizations and predicting the existence of material independent shifts.","Gotte, JB; Dennis, MR",40,28,NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,Generalized shifts and weak values for polarization components of reflected light beams,2012

Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift of a transverse-magnetic (TM) wave reflected from a semi-infinite anisotropic metamaterial consisting of aligned metallic nanowires in a dielectric matrix is investigated. Based on Bruggeman effective medium theory, we obtain the conditions for realizing the negative refraction, which are dependent on both the incident wavelength and the volume fraction of metallic inclusions. Then, we investigate the GH shifts from the composite metamaterial with positive and negative refractions with the stationary-phase method. Numerical results show that the enhancement of GH shift can be achieved near the pseudo-Brewster angle for small volume fractions and at the close-to-grazing incidence for large volume fractions. We further find that for positively refractive metamaterials with weak absorption, one can realize the transition from negative GH shift to the positive one by adjusting the incident wavelength. However, for negatively refractive composite metamaterials, the reversal of the GH shifts may take place by the adjustment of the volume fraction instead of the incident wavelength. In order to demonstrate the validity of the stationary-phase approach, numerical simulations are performed for a Gaussian-shaped beam. In the end, by using COMSOL simulation, a comprehensive understanding is given and the above analysis is confirmed.

"Reflection and refraction of a finite-power Airy beam at the interface between two dielectric media are investigated analytically and numerically. The formulation takes into account the paraxial nature of the optical beams to derive convenient field evolution equations in coordinate frames moving along Snell's refraction and reflection axes. Through numerical simulations, the self-accelerating dynamics of the Airy-like refracted and reflected beams are observed. Of special interest are the cases of critical incidence at Brewster and total-internal-reflection (TIR) angles. In the former case, we find that the reflected beam achieves self-healing, despite the severe suppression of a part of its spectrum, while, in the latter case, the beam remains nearly unaffected except for the Goos-Hanchen shift. The self-accelerating quality persists even if the beam is trapped by multiple TIRs inside a dielectric film. The grazing incidence of an Airy beam at the interface between two media with close refractive indices is also investigated, revealing that the interface can act as a filter depending on the beam scale and tilt.

The transitions from the positive IF shift to the negative IF shift have been observed with the increase of the velocity of the moving object. Further-more, our calculations show that some unusual GH effects can also be caused by the movement of the medium. The physical origins for these phenomena have been analyzed.

"The partial derivative equations of Zoeppritz equations are established and the derivatives of each matrix entry with respect to wave vectors are derived in this paper. By solving the partial derivative equations we obtained the partial derivatives of seismic wave reflection coefficients with respect to wave vectors, and computed the Goos-Hanchen shift for reflected P- and VS-waves. By plotting the curves of Goos-Hanchen shift, we gained some new insight into the lateral shift of seismic reflection wave. The lateral shifts are very large for glancing wave or the wave of the incidence angle near the critical angle, meaning that the seismic wave propagates a long distance along the reflection interface before returning to the first medium. For the reflection waves of incidence angles away from the critical angle, the lateral shift is in the same order of magnitude as the wavelength. The lateral shift varies significantly with different reflection interfaces. For example, the reflected P-wave has a negative shift at the reflection interface between mudstone and sandstone. The reflected VS-wave has a large lateral shift at or near the critical angle. The lateral shift of the reflected VS-wave tends to be zero when the incidence angle approaches 90A degrees. These observations suggest that Goos-Hanchen effect has a great influence on the reflection wave of wide-angles. The correction for the error caused by Goos-Hanchen effect, therefore, should be made before seismic data processing, such as the depth migration and the normal-moveout correction. With the theoretical foundation established in this paper, we can further study the correction of Goos-Hanchen effect for the reflection wave of large incidence angle.","Liu, FP; Meng, XJ; Xiao, JQ; Wang, AL; Yang, CC",2,39,SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES,The Goos-Hanchen shift of wide-angle seismic reflection wave,2012

We have considered the propagation process of the phase-matched array of singular beams through a uniaxial crystal. We have revealed that local beams in the array are rotated when propagating. However the right and left rotations are unequal. There are at least two processes responsible for the array rotation: the interference of local beams and the spatial depolarization. The interference takes place in the vortex birth and annihilation events forming the symmetrical part of the rotation. The depolarization process contributes to the asymmetry of the rotation that is called the rotational spin Hall effect. It can be brought to light due to the difference between the envelopes of the dependences of the angular displacement on the inclination angle of the local beams or the crystal length reaching the value of some angular degree. The direction of the additional array rotation is exclusively defined by the handedness of the circular polarization in the initial beam array.

"From the viewpoint of classical electrodynamics, we identify the role of spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion in spin Hall effect (SHE) of light. We introduce a distinct separation between spin and orbital angular momenta to clarify the spin-orbital interaction in conventional beam refraction. We demonstrate that the refractive index gradient can enhance or suppress the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion, and thus can control the SHE of light. We suggest that the metamaterial whose refractive index can be tailored arbitrarily may become a good candidate for amplifying or eliminating the SHE of light, and by properly facilitating the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion the SHE may be enhanced dramatically.

"We studied electromagnetic wave transmission through layered structures that include negative index materials. The excitation of leaky guided modes leads to the formation of anomalous lateral shifts in the reflected beam with a double-peak structure and in the transmitted beam with a single-peak structure. In the absence of losses, we demonstrate that the total transparency (i.e. zero reflection) of the slab waveguide with the negative index material can be achieved under conditions in which high reflectivity is normally expected. We demonstrate the trade-off effect between the high transmission and the high lateral shift. This peculiar effect exists not only for the pure TE or the pure TM polarization of the obliquely incident radiation, but also under certain circumstances for both of them simultaneously i.e. for the nonpolarized radiation.

In contrast to the usual approach dealing with the beam angular spectrum, we apply the continuity conditions to explicit spatial representations of the electric and magnetic fields on both sides of the boundary. It is shown that the polarization-dependent distortions of the beam trajectory (in particular, the ""longitudinal"" Goos-Hanchen shift and the ""lateral"" Imbert-Fedorov shift of the beam center of gravity) are directly connected to the incident beam longitudinal component and appear due to its transformation at the boundary.","Bekshaev, AY",6,33,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Polarization-dependent transformation of a paraxial beam upon reflection and refraction: A real-space approach,2012
"By applying geometrical optics (GO) to each plane-wave component of a nonparaxial electromagnetic (em) Bessel beam carrying spin and orbital angular momentum (SAM and OAM), we calculate the shift of the beam centroid during propagation in a weakly inhomogeneous, isotropic medium. Apart from recovering the transverse spin and orbital Hall shifts expected from paraxial theory, the nonparaxial treatment reveals additional shifts in both the transverse and lateral directions. When the propagation is close to perpendicular to the refractive index gradient, these shifts should be significant also for nearly paraxial beams. Suggestions are given for an experimental verification of the results.","Nordblad, E",2,32,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Transverse and lateral shifts of the center of gravity of a refracted nonparaxial Bessel beam,2012
"When a beam of light is reflected by a smooth surface its behavior deviates from geometrical optics predictions. Such deviations are quantified by the so-called spatial and angular Goos-Hanchen (GH) and Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shifts of the reflected beam. These shifts depend upon the shape of the incident beam, its polarization and on the material composition of the reflecting surface. In this paper we suggest a novel approach that allows one to unambiguously isolate the beam-shape dependent aspects of GH and IF shifts.

When total internal reflection occurs, the lateral shift curves as the incident angle have been figured out for a linearly polarized incident wave. The shift directions of the TM and TE components in the reflected wave are opposite when the incident angle is between the two critical angles of the eigen-waves. Both TM and TE waves will have positive lateral shift once the incident angle is larger than the total internal reflection angle.

We study the reflection of a tightly focused Gaussian beam off a near symmetric resonant tunneling structure comprising two identical coupled waveguides. The coupled waveguides are loaded on each side by a spacer layer and a high index prism. Reflection of a Gaussian beam from such a resonant structure is associated with beam distortion and even beam splitting. We start with the distortion of the beam profile for a symmetric structure as a function of various parameters of the system. The broken spatial symmetry is introduced through the reference channel on one side and the sample channel on the other side as spacer layers. We monitor the dip in the beam profile when the two channels are filled with the sample and the reference liquid. We show that presence and absence of hemoglobin and its oxygenation states can be quantified by looking at the beam profile dip.

"Recently, the bending efficiency of vertical slot waveguide with different structure has been analyzed. However, the interface roughness of the waveguide which have high E-field intensity induces to high scattering loss. In addition, a vertical slot fabrication involves in a very narrow region etching which can cause large roughness in the vertical interfaces. In order to reduce the propagation loss and facilitate the fabrication process, horizontal slot waveguides have been proposed and fabricated, recently. In this paper, we have designed and analyzed total internal reflection (TIR) mirror for using a resonator based on horizontal slot waveguide. Our proposed structure is consisted horizontal slot waveguide of rib type to enlarge contact region with TIR mirror. To analyze Goos-Hanchen shift, we have theoretically calculated length of evanescent field at TIR mirror using 3D-FDTD method.

"Total internal reflection (TIR) of a pulsed light beam from vacuum incident upon an ideal non-absorbing plasma was investigated theoretically using the Fourier transform method. Because of the Goos-Hanchen effect, the reflected pulsed beam undergoes distortions such as carrier frequency shift and chirp. The distortions are magnified on condition that the pulsed beam is TM-polarized and illuminates the interface at large angle of incidence, which should be avoided for reflection of pulsed beam upon optical mirrors with metal film. Meanwhile, it is shown that the Goos-Hanchen shift and time delay of this TIR can be both positive and negative, which is consistent with the results obtained from stationary phase theory.","Liu, XM; Shi, Y; Zhu, PF; Zhang, YL; Yang, QF",1,31,JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS,Total internal reflection of pulsed light beam upon ideal non-absorbing plasma,2012

"The problem of a Gaussian beam that is incident on a plane dielectric interface from a denser dielectric medium to a rarer one and is reflected at the interface has been important research subjects studied by many researchers. In this paper, we have obtained a novel uniform asymptotic solution for reflection and beam shift of the Gaussian beam that is incident on the interface from the denser medium. The uniform asymptotic solution consists of the geometrically reflected beam, the lateral beam if any, and the newly derived transition beam which plays an important role in the transition region near the critical angle of the total reflection. We have confirmed the validity of the uniform asymptotic solution by comparing with the reference solution obtained numerically from the integral representation. We have shown that, in addition to the Goos-Hanchen shift and the angular shift, the Gaussian beam is shifted to either direction by the interference of the geometrically reflected beam and the lateral beam near the critical angle of the total reflection.","Quang, DT; Goto, K; Kawano, T; Ishihara, T",1,30,IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRONICS,A Uniform Asymptotic Solution for Reflection and Beam Shift of a Gaussian Beam at a Plane Dielectric Interface,2012

"The Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect, which is enhanced by the resonance of guided modes in the symmetrical metal-cladding waveguide (SMCW) structure, is used to detect slight variations of the light wavelength. The SMCW is a special optical waveguide structure, typically consisting of a guiding layer and two metal-cladding layers. Compared with traditional dielectric waveguide, the SMCW possesses a broader range of effective refractive index (RI), i.e. from zero to the RI of the guiding layer, which enables directly coupling of light energy from free space into the waveguide. Theoretical analysis indicates that the GH effect is closely related to the intrinsic damping and the radiative damping of the waveguide structure. Proper parameters are selected to match the two dampings, and great enhancement of the GH shift is obtained consequently. Ultrahigh-order modes excited in the SMCW with a sub-millimeter scale of the guiding layer exhibit a strong dispersion effect of the light wavelength, which manifests itself as wavelength-dependent lateral shift of the reflected beam. Position sensitive detector is used to monitor the lateral beam shift which changes rapidly with respect to the light wavelength. Since the detecting signal is proportional to the displacement of the light beam, the measurement can effectively avoid being affected by the fluctuation of the light intensity. A wavelength resolution of 0.2 pm near the wavelength of 859 nm is demonstrated in the experiment.","Wang, Y; Cao, ZQ; Jiang, XG; Li, Q",0,17,"6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ADVANCED OPTICAL MANUFACTURING AND TESTING TECHNOLOGIES: OPTOELECTRONIC MATERIALS AND DEVICES FOR SENSING, IMAGING, AND SOLAR ENERGY",Wavelength sensing based on the Goos-Hachen effect in the symmetrical metal-cladding waveguide structure,2012

The far-field patterns are shown to differ between lasing modes, unlike in large cavities where lasing modes exhibit universal emission directionality determined by chaotic ray dynamics.

It results from weak coupling of nearly isotropic high-quality resonances to anisotropic low-quality resonances, combined with chiral symmetry breaking of clockwise and counterclockwise propagating waves. The latter is described by an extended ray dynamics which includes the Goos-Hanchen shift and the Fresnel filtering. Mode hybridization and wave effects in open cavities make it possible to control the output properties of individual lasing modes in wavelength-scale lasers.","Song, QH; Ge, L; Wiersig, J; Shim, JB; Unterhinninghofen, J; Eberspacher, A; Fang, W; Solomon, GS; Cao, H",15,61,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Wavelength-scale deformed microdisk lasers,2011

"We study shifts of the beam centroid of linearly polarized paraxial Laguerre-Gaussian beams reflected and refracted at an interface of isotropic dielectric in the cylindrical coordinate system. According to the Fresnel approximation and the Taylor series expansion, we derive analytical expressions for transverse and longitudinal shifts and their general relationship with topological charge in the cases of partial and total reflection, respectively. It is shown that in the partial reflection regime, transverse shifts of both reflected and refracted beams are in proportion to the topological charge of beams and their directions are determined by the sign of the topological charge, while only the value of longitudinal shift is related to the topological charge. In the regime of total reflection, the shift of reflected beam centroid is independent of topological charge. To verify our analytical results, we perform numerical simulations of the shifts of reflected and refracted beams directly and indicate the applicable condition of the analytical expressions.

This last feature introduces current into the electromagnetic boundary conditions. For the s-polarization case, the presence of the graphene-induced surface charge causes a much larger GH shift than without charge, and its usual monotonic behavior is altered. In the p-polarization case, surface charge and current may alter the conventional GH shift in opposite ways.

"In-plane (lateral) and out-of-plane (transverse) shifts in the direction of arbitrarily polarized electromagnetic waves in a denser medium, reflected totally or partially at an interface with a rarer medium, are calculated exactly, in terms of the deviation of the Poynting vector from radial. The shifts are analogous to the Goos-Hanchen and Fedorov-Imbert shifts for beams. There is a transverse shift even for unreflected dipole radiation if the polarization is not linear. With reflection, there is a transverse shift for linear polarization, provided this is not pure transverse electric or transverse magnetic. The contributions from the geometrical ray, the lateral ray that interferes strongly with it, and the large peak at the Brewster angle (for transverse magnetic polarization), are calculated asymptotically far from the geometrical image. At the critical angle, the lowest order asymptotics is inadequate and a more sophisticated treatment is devised, reproducing the exact shifts accurately.","Berry, MV",12,24,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES,Lateral and transverse shifts in reflected dipole radiation,2011

We consider the case when the frequency of the guided light is greater than the plasma frequency so that the refractive index of the substrate is less than unity.

"Based on a general beam-propagation model, we derive in the paraxial approximation the analytical expressions for the spatial transverse shift (TS) and the angular TS of a beam reflected from the air-chiral interface. The results show that the TSs are closely related to the propagation behaviors of the right-circularly polarized (RCP) and the left-circularly polarized (LCP) waves in the chiral medium. When the L(R)CP wave becomes evanescent, the left (right)-elliptically polarized incident beam suffers a smaller TS. When the L(R) CP wave propagates, the left (right)-elliptically polarized incident beam experiences a greater TS. When the total internal reflection happens, neither of the two elliptically polarized incident beams suffers TSs. TSs can be controlled not only by adjusting the central angle of incidence, but also by tailoring the permittivity, permeability, and chirality parameter of the chiral medium.","Xu, GD; Zang, TC; Mao, HM; Pan, T",18,42,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Transverse shifts of a reflected light beam from the air-chiral interface,2011
"It is well-known that the variations of Goos-Hanchen shifts (GHSs) are closely associated with the energy flux provided by evanescent states in the case of total internal reflection. However, when the frustrated total internal reflection (FIR) is realized with double-prism system operated in the microwave frequency, we observe that the GHSs for the reflected beam show periodic, resembling the phenomenon for transmitted beams reported in the literatures, versus either the operating frequency or the air layer thickness, which is different from the variation of the corresponding reflected energy. Moreover, in another FTIR based system fabricated by a composite absorptive material slab with a two-dimensional top layer of frequency selective surface (FSS), the GHSs for reflected beam are discovered as not only resonant but also negative with the incidence of transverse electric that is TE polarized, just as predicted theoretically in the literatures.

"Investigating the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in linear and nonlinear materials (with third-order nonlinearity), we derived a general expression for the dwell time valid for all linear media, as well as its relation with the group delay. The obtained results indicate that, for a nonmagnetic lossless material, the group delay reduces to the sum of the dwell time and the self-interference time. Calculations confirmed the occurrence of the Hartman effect in negative-refractive-index metamaterials (the dwell time saturates with increasing obstacle length), as well as the negative group delay in a certain spectral regime. Analysis of the Goos-Hanchen shift, in case of an obstacle made of negative-refractive-index metamaterial embedded in a dielectric with saturable nonlinearity, showed that there is no impact on the dwell time, while various effects on the group delay may be achieved, including its reduction or even preservation for nonzero incident angles.

This lateral shift at the resonance of the LRSP can be two orders of magnitude greater than a wavelength. The analytical formulas of the radiative damping and the intrinsic damping of the LRSP are derived. It is found that the thicknesses of the second medium and the metal film determine the radiative damping and the intrinsic damping is illuminated by the imaginary part of the dielectric constant of the metal.

In order to show this equivalence, we start by describing the first- and second-order nongeometric effects, and we calculate them analytically by superposing two plane waves. Finally, these results are compared with those obtained for the nongeometric effects of Gaussian beams in isotropic interfaces and are applied to different types of interfaces.

"The geometric Spin Hall Effect of Light (geometric SHEL) amounts to a polarization-dependent positional shift when a light beam is observed from a reference frame tilted with respect to its direction of propagation. Motivated by this intriguing phenomenon, the energy density of the light beam is decomposed into its Cartesian components in the tilted reference frame. This illustrates the occurrence of the characteristic shift and the significance of the effective response function of the detector.

We introduce the concept of a tilted polarizing interface and provide a scheme for its experimental implementation. A light beam passing through such an interface undergoes a shift resembling the original geometric SHEL in a tilted reference frame. This displacement is generated at the polarizer and its occurrence does not depend on the properties of the detection system. We give explicit results for this novel type of geometric SHEL and show that at grazing incidence this effect amounts to a displacement of multiple wavelengths, a shift larger than the one introduced by Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects.","Korger, J; Aiello, A; Gabriel, C; Banzer, P; Kolb, T; Marquardt, C; Leuchs, G",9,32,APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS,Geometric Spin Hall Effect of Light at polarizing interfaces,2011

"The lateral shifts from a slab of lossy chiral metamaterial are predicted for both perpendicular and parallel components of the reflected field, when the transverse electric (TE)-polarized incident wave is applied. By introducing different chirality parameter, the lateral shifts can be large positive or negative near the pseudo-Brewster angle. It is found that the lateral shifts from the negative chiral slab are affected by the angle of incidence and the chirality parameter. In the presence of inevitable loss of the chiral slab, the enhanced lateral shifts will be decreased, and the pseudo-Brewster angle will disappear correspondingly. For the negative chiral slab with loss which is invisible for the right circularly polarized (RCP) wave, we find that the loss of the chiral slab will lead to the fluctuation of the lateral shift with respect to the thickness of the chiral slab.

"The Goos-Hanchen shift (GHS) that accompanies total internal reflection (TIR) of a monochromatic p- or s-polarized light beam at a planar interface between a dense medium of incidence of refractive index n(0) and a rarer medium of refractive index n(1) < n(0) is considered as a function of the index ratio, N = n(0)/n(1), and angle of incidence, phi(0). At a unique incidence angle phi(0e) = sin(-1)[2/(N(2) + 1)](1/2) the GHS is the same for the p and s polarizations, hence the shift becomes independent of polarization. Other significant characteristics associated with TIR at the special angle phi(0e) are identified. It is also shown that the GHS is nearly independent of phi(0) in the range 45 degrees <= phi(0) <= 90 degrees if the incident light is s-polarized and the index ratio N > 2.5.

Thus, we design an EDG demultiplexer with a very low noise floor based on silicon waveguide.","Song, J; Ding, JF",3,11,IEEE PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY LETTERS,Analytical Design of Total-Internal-Reflection Grating Demultiplexers With a Low Noise Floor,2010
"As the fabrication of wavelength-scale optical microcavities is becoming feasible, extended ray models which include first-order wave corrections have attracted considerable interest. By using such a model, we find an unexpected shift of phase-space structures in momentum direction which can be attributed to the Goos-Hanchen shift in position direction and the boundary curvature (""periodic orbit shift,"" POS); this shift is calculated analytically for a general cavity shape. By comparing it to wave calculations in the special case of a lima on-shaped microcavity, it is shown that mode localization occurs on the shifted, rather than the original, phase-space structures. Comparing of our analytical result to literature data, we find good agreement, which suggests that the POS may be responsible for many cases of previously reported, but unexplained, mismatches between Husimi functions and the ray-dynamical phase space.","Unterhinninghofen, J; Wiersig, J",18,32,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Interplay of Goos-Hanchen shift and boundary curvature in deformed microdisks,2010

"We experimentally demonstrate a general optical pump-probe technique to observe the spin Hall effect of light (SHEL) in an absorbing medium. In essence, a locally confined pump-induced modification of a material's absorptivity can effectively be used as an induced aperture allowing one to detect the transversely displaced circular polarization components of an incident beam through differential transmission techniques. We consider linear absorption mechanisms such as free-carrier absorption and Pauli blocking as well as nonlinear absorption processes such as two-photon absorption. For absorption mechanisms that do not depend on light polarization, the SHEL of the probe beam is obtained directly, while polarization-dependent properties give an effective SHEL displacement that depends on the action of the SHEL on both pump and probe beams. Using 150 fs pump, 820 nm pump and probe pulses we observe SHEL effects in silicon via free-carrier absorption. SHEL effects are also observed via Pauli blocking at 820 nm and two-photon absorption at 1550 nm in GaAs using similar to 150 fs pump and probe pulses.","Menard, JM; Mattacchione, AE; van Driel, HM; Hautmann, C; Betz, M",34,35,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Ultrafast optical imaging of the spin Hall effect of light in semiconductors,2010

It was investigated that, at large incident angle, TE and TM polarized incident beams experience opposite lateral shifts simultaneously, which can be enhanced to hundreds of micrometers. This is due to the strong mode dispersion on the SMCW when the low order mode is excited.

"A large negative or positive lateral shift of the beam reflected from a left-handed prism coated with a weakly absorbing dielectric film is investigated theoretically. It is shown that the large lateral shift can be negative as well as positive due to the formation of the unusual guided modes in the weakly absorbing film near the resonant condition, which acts the same effect as the surface wave. This unusual guided wave can travel a longer distance than the surface wave. These giant negative and positive lateral shifts are almost fifty times larger than that from the lossless structure [Wang in Appl. Phys. Lett. 87:221102, 2005].

"Basic features of narrow optical beam interactions with a dielectric interface are analysed. As it was recently shown, two types of paraxial beams - elegant Hermite-Gaussians of linear polarization and elegant Laguerre-Gaussians of circular polarization - can be treated as vector normal modes of the interface [1]. In this contribution the problem of normal modes is discussed with special attention paid for the case of beam oblique incidence. Excitation of higher-order modes by cross-polarization coupling is described and it is shown that this process critically depends on a propagation direction of the incident beam. Besides the expected changes of mode indices induced by generalised transmission and reflection matrices, the new phenomenon of optical vortex spectral splitting at the interface is revealed and off-axis spectral placements of the splitted vortices are determined.

"Investigation on the phase shifts of higher-order reflected light from a two-dimensional photonic crystal ( PC) demonstrates that the phase shift of -mth order reflected light is symmetric with respect to the line of k(x) = m pi/b in the frequency-wave vector domain, where k(x) and b denote the incident wave vector component along the surface and the period of the PC along the surface, respectively, and m is an integer. Such phase symmetry originates from the periodicity of a PC along the surface. When higher-order propagating waves appear between two band edges of a stop band, the phase change of the 0th order reflection is generally not pi as reported before. Moreover, the reflection phase can be adjusted and designed by changing the cylinder radii of the surface layer.

A spin-dependent shift of the beam centroid perpendicular to the refractive index gradient for the light beam through an air-LHM interface is demonstrated. For a certain circularly polarized component, whether the transverse shift is positive or negative depends on the magnitude of the refractive index gradient. Very surprisingly, the spin Hall effect in the LHM is unreversed, although the sign of refractive index gradient is reversed. The physics underlying this counterintuitive effect is that the spin angular momentum of photons is unreversed. Further, we reveal that the angular shift in the LHM is reversed due to the negative diffraction. These findings provide alternative evidence for that the linear momentum of photons is reversed, while the spin angular momentum is unreversed in the LHM.","Luo, HL; Wen, SC; Shu, WX; Tang, ZX; Zou, YH; Fan, DY",54,42,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Spin Hall effect of a light beam in left-handed materials,2009

"A radiometric framework is described for modeling the propagation of nonparaxial scalar fields of any degree of coherence past planar boundaries (or composite interfaces) between homogeneous, isotropic nonabsorptive media in three dimensions. The transformation is shown to be, to lowest order, that predicted by classical radiometry but potentially including a Goos-Hanchen shift. Higher-order corrections take the form of coefficients multiplied by derivatives of the basic estimate.

"Using the phase shift of reflection coefficient of SH seismic wave at the interface of strata, we derived the lateral shift and group time delay of total reflected SH seismic wave, given formulae of normal moveout of Goos-Hanchen effect, discussed the influence of Goos-Hanchen effect on normal moveout of SH-wave, and drawn the curves of lateral shift, group time delay, normal moveout of Goos-Hanchen effect and error of normal moveout caused by Goos-Hanchen effect with respect to the angle of incidence. The results show that for glancing wave or angle of incidence being near the critical angle, the lateral shift and group time delay are very large. A large error can be caused by Goos-Hanchen effect; In other angle of incidence the lateral shift (group time delay) is the same order of magnitude as the wavelength (period); So Goos-Hanchen effect can bring about large influence on the travel time of SH-wave. The error correction of Goos-Hanchen effect should be made before seismic data processing.","Liu, FP; Wang, AL; Li, RZ; Chen, HG; Yang, CC",4,29,CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION,The influence on normal moveout of total reflected SH-wave by Goos-Hanchen effect at an interface of strata,2009
"The origin of negative and positive lateral shifts of the light beams in a dielectric slab configuration is investigated from the viewpoint of the interference between multiple light beams, due to the multiple reflections and transmissions inside the slab. It is shown that the whole reflected and transmitted beams with negative shifts can be obtained from the successively reflected and transmitted constituents, respectively, with positive displacements predicted from geometrical optics. When the slab's thickness is much smaller in comparison with the width of the beam waist, the reshaping reflected and transmitted beams retain the profile of the incident beam. The physical mechanism presented here could also be applicable in investigating other counterintuitive phenomena, such as the superluminal traversal time in quantum tunneling and dispersive media.","Chen, X; Li, CF",9,37,JOURNAL OF OPTICS A-PURE AND APPLIED OPTICS,Negative and positive lateral shifts: a result of beam reshaping caused by interference,2009

"A novel biosensor based on a triangular resonator with a long evanescent field on a total internal reflection (TIR) mirror is proposed, and its sensing properties are analyzed for the first time. The sensing properties of the triangular ring resonator are found to be useful in realizing biological and chemical sensors, when the TIR mirror with a sharp incident angle increases the evanescent field owing to the Goos-Hanchen shift. For transverse electric polarized light, an extinction ratio of 16 dB is achieved by changing the refractive index of 1 x 10(-5) in the outer region of the TIR mirror block. Then, an extinction ratio of 28 dB and a resonance shift of 160 pm are observed by changing the refractive index of 1 x 10(-5) for transverse magnetic polarization.

"We have investigated the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shifts in frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) studied with wave-packet propagation. In the first-order approximation of the transmission coefficient, the GH shift is exactly the expression given by a stationary phase method, thus saturating an asymptotic constant in two different ways depending on the angle of incidence. Taking the second-order approximation into account, the GH shift does not saturate with increasing gap width when the small beam size is used. The GH shift increases by decreasing the beamwidth at the small incidence angles, while for the large incidence angles it reveals a strong decrease by decreasing the beamwidth. These phenomena offer the better understanding of the GH shift and tunneling delay time in FTIR.","Chen, X; Li, CF; Wei, RR; Zhang, Y",15,37,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Goos-Hanchen shifts in frustrated total internal reflection studied with wave-packet propagation,2009

"The Law of Reflection of a light ray incident upon a mirror (theta(in) = theta(out)) was first formulated by Euclid around 300 BC in his book Catoptrics(1); it has been a tenet of geometrical optics ever since. However, more recently, a small angular deviation of the Law of Reflection has been predicted for a physical light beam when this is regarded as the implementation of a ray(2-5). The deviation is a diffractive consequence of the angular dependence of the reflectivity and should occur for any mirror with less than 100% reflectivity. We report here experimental proof of this angular deviation by determining the direction of an optical beam after reflection from an air glass interface, using a position detector with nanometre resolution. Our results are relevant for angular metrology in general and cantilever-based surface microscopies in particular. Analogous angular deviations are expected for reflection of acoustic waves and quantum matter waves.","Merano, M; Aiello, A; van Exter, MP; Woerdman, JP",105,25,NATURE PHOTONICS,Observing angular deviations in the specular reflection of a light beam,2009

"The Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect is an interference effect on total internal reflection at an interface, resulting in a shift sigma of the reflected beam along the interface. We show that the GH effect at a p-n interface in graphene depends on the pseudospin (sublattice) degree of freedom of the massless Dirac fermions, and find a sign change of sigma at angle of incidence alpha(*)=arcsin sin alpha(c) determined by the critical angle alpha(c) for total reflection. In an n-doped channel with p-doped boundaries the GH effect doubles the degeneracy of the lowest propagating mode, introducing a twofold degeneracy on top of the usual spin and valley degeneracies. This can be observed as a stepwise increase by 8e(2)/h of the conductance with increasing channel width.","Beenakker, CWJ; Sepkhanov, RA; Akhmerov, AR; Tworzydlo, J",116,15,PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS,Quantum Goos-Hanchen Effect in Graphene,2009

"We investigate the predicted lateral shift of a normally incident electromagnetic beam upon reflection off an antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field in terms of power flow. In the absence of damping, there is power flow along the interface in the reststrahl regions, even at normal incidence, and this leads directly to a shift similar to the Goos-Hanchen shift normally associated with oblique incidence radiation. In the bulk regions, such a shift is still possible even without this type of power flow. In this case the beam transmitted into the antiferromagnet is displaced in the direction opposite to that of the reflected beam, thus ensuring overall flux continuity.","Lima, F; Dumelow, T; Albuquerque, EL; da Costa, JAP",12,28,PHYSICAL REVIEW B,Power flow associated with the Goos-Hanchen shift of a normally incident electromagnetic beam reflected off an antiferromagnet,2009

"Optical microcavities are open billiards for light in which electromagnetic waves can, however, be confined by total internal reflection at dielectric boundaries. These resonators enrich the class of model systems in the field of quantum chaos and are an ideal testing ground for the correspondence of ray and wave dynamics that, typically, is taken for granted. Using phase-space methods we show that this assumption has to be corrected towards the long-wavelength limit. Generalizing the concept, of Husimi functions to dielectric interfaces, we find that curved interfaces require a semiclassical correction of Fresael's law due to an interference effect; called Goos-Hanchen shift. It, is accompanied by the so-called Fresnel filtering which, in turn, corrects Snell's law. These two contributions are especially important near the critical angle. They are of similar magnitude and correspond to ray displacements in independent, phase-space directions that can be incorporated in an adjusted reflection law. We show that deviations from ray-wave correspondence can be straightforwardly understood with the resulting adjusted reflection law and discuss its consequences for the phase-space dynamics in optical billiards.","Hentschel, M",3,32,"ADVANCES IN SOLID STATE PHYSICS, VOL 48",Optical Microcavities as Quantum-Chaotic Model Systems: Openness Makes the Difference!,2009

"Optical absorption of infrared radiation under total internal reflection in a novel sensor has been utilized to investigate the soot contamination of diesel engine oil by response surface methodology in factorial experiments. Sensor response showed highly significant dependence on oil soot concentration and temperature, in which the effect of the soot was greatest. The soot contamination of the optical rod in engine oil was found to be a surface phenomenon which showed little or no dependence on bulk oil shearing displacement below 500 rpm. The quadratic effect of sensor response to soot concentration was very high due to the agglomeration of soot particles, derived from the high surface energy of carbon soot. Test results of this optical absorption technique were in conformance with those other oil analysis techniques such as UV spectrophotometry, total acid number, viscosimetry, optical microscopy and EPMA. The technique proved to be more reliable than RDE emission spectrometry which showed ambiguous results due to colloidal suspension of soot particles in oil.

It is found that the lateral displacements for TM and TE waves have different characteristics. Only the TM mode is affected by the gyrotropy.

"The group time delay (GTD) formulae of quasi-total reflection of inhomogeneous P-polarized electromagnetic waves (P-PEW, whose electric field parallels to the plane of incidence), caused by the Goos-Hanchen effect, is derived by the phase shift of the wave. A numerical example where the frequency equals to 1 GHz is given. The curves of calculating results show that there are three discontinuous points at the critical angle of phase shift vector, the critical angle of attenuation vector and 90 degrees. When the angle of incidence is equal to one of these three angles, the GTD will become infinite, and the electromagnetic wave will propagate along the interface. The GTD will be very large, when the angle of incidence is close to one of these three angles. The results indicate that there is an important relationship between the two critical angles and the conductivity and permittivity of the two strata, and that the GTD has an important relationship with the angle of incidence. These results can be used to determine the lithology of the strata and to delimit the interfaces of strata more effectively.

"Recently, an interesting phenomenon of spatial localization of optical modes along periodic ray trajectories near avoided resonance crossings has been observed [Wiersig, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 253901 (2006)]. For the case of a microdisk cavity with elliptical cross section, we use the Husimi function to analyze this localization in phase space. Moreover, we present a semiclassical explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the Goos-Hanchen shift, which works very well even deep in the wave regime. This semiclassical correction to the ray dynamics modifies the phase-space structure such that modes can localize either on stable islands or along unstable periodic ray trajectories.","Unterhinninghofen, J; Wiersig, J; Hentschel, M",45,63,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Goos-Hanchen shift and localization of optical modes in deformed microcavities,2008
"The laser damage on a total internal reflection (TIR) surface as well as on entrance and exit faces was evaluated to design a zig-zag slab laser. Incorporating a phase shift by the Goos-Hiinchen effect on a TIR surface of a laser slab in contact with water, formulas for a laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) were modified. We determined a method for the designing the geometry of a zig-zag slab laser based on LIDT. A thin film for anti-reflection (AR) with a high LIDT must be formed on the entrance and exit faces of a laser slab glass. A sol-gel thin film was adopted for the AR coating of a high-power laser due to its high LIDT. We devised an effective dip-coating method to form a sol-gel thin film uniformly on a small area. The LIDT of the sol-gel thin film was measured and evaluated with a single mode Q-switch Nd:YAG laser by a one-on-one measurement technique.","Matsumoto, O; Kanabe, T; Yasuhara, R; Kurita, T; Sekine, T; Kawashima, T; Norimatsu, T; Izawa, Y; Nakatsuka, M; Miyamoto, M; Kan, H; Furukawa, H; Motokoshi, S",2,13,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,Analysis and evaluation of laser-induced damage of zig-zag slab laser amplifier,2008
"We propose a waveguide structure in which the tunneling or leakage of guided light results in a type of temporary light trapping. This can be possible by the adoption of a thin clad composed of a negative-refractive-index medium, which, with a conventional dielectric core, produces a backward Goos-Hanchen shift whose amount is critically dependent on the thickness of the clad. At an appropriate clad thickness, the forward propagation of the light in the core can be completely compensated by the backward Goos-Hanchen shift; thus, we can make the net propagation distance of the light exactly zero, i.e., we can trap the light. This trap is temporary since the trapped light tunnels out completely through the thin clad after a short time.","Kim, KY",11,17,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,Tunneling-induced temporary light trapping in negative-index-clad slab waveguide,2008
"The Goos-Hanchen shift at the surface of a uniaxially anisotropic left-handed material film is investigated, for the situation of that there is an arbitrary angle between the optical axis and the interface of the material. The analytical expressions of the Goos-Hanchen shifts are derived, for both cases of that the total reflection occurs and does not occur at the first interface. The sign of the Goos-Hanchen shifts in the two situations is analysed. The results show that the Goos-Hanchen shift of the reflected wave is the same as that of the transmitted one for the case that the total reflection does not occur at the first interface; the Goos-Hanchen shift of the transmitted wave oscillates as the thickness of the film is increased, and its overall tendency is increased; the Goos-Hanchen shift of the transmitted wave realizes its absolute maximum when the transmitted wave resonances, the absolute maximum is almost several 10 times of the wavelength of the incident wave; the Goos-Hanchen shift of the transmitted wave is significantly influenced by the incident angle and the angle between the optical axis and the interface.

The results show that reflected wave has negative Goos-Hanchen shift; for glancing wave or near-critical incidence angle, a large error can be caused by Goos-Hanchen effect. In other angle of incidence the lateral shift is the same order of magnitude as the wavelength. So Goos-Hanchen effect can bring about large influence on the travel time of P-wave and SV-wave.

"It is shown that a Gaussian light beam transmitting through a planar thin dielectric slab in the air undergoes four different effects, i.e. lateral Goos-Hanchen-like (GHL) displacement, angular deflection, width modification and longitudinal focal shift as compared with the results predicted by geometrical optics. According to the Taylor expansion of the exponent of transmission coefficient when expressed as an exponential form, the lateral GHL displacement and the angular deflection are the first-order effects and can be negative or positive. The width modification and the longitudinal focal shift are the second-order effects and can also be positive or negative.

From this theory, the quantization characteristics of the GH and IF displacements are obtained, and the Artmann formula for the GH displacement is derived. It is found that the eigenstates of the GH displacement are the two orthogonal linear polarizations in this two-form representation, and the eigenstates of the IF displacement are the two orthogonal circular polarizations. The theoretical predictions are found to be in agreement with recent experimental results.","Li, CF",36,26,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Unified theory for Goos-Hanchen and imbert-fedorov effects,2007
"Since the Goos-Hanchen (GH) effect is the displacement of the totally reflected beam at a dielectric interface from the position prediction by geometrical reflection, the concept of GH displacement is applicable only when the reflected beam retains the shape of the geometrically reflected or incident beam. The necessary and sufficient condition has been advanced for the totally reflected beam to retain the shape of the incident beam. Numerical simulations have been performed to confirm this condition. It has been shown that the GH displacement results from the mechanism of beam reshaping due to the linear dependence of the reflection phase shift upon the parallel component of the wave vector, in the interval in which the angular spectral distribution function of the incident beam is appreciable.","Shi, JL; Li, CF; Wang, Q",6,30,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B,Theory of the Goos-Hanchen displacement in total internal reflection,2007

"In this paper we report on a method for quantitative measurement and characterization of the Goos-Hanchen effect based upon the real world performance of optical sources. A numerical model of a nonideal plane wave is developed in terms of uniform divergence properties. This model is applied to the Goos-Hanchen shift equations to determine beam shift displacement characteristics, which provides quantitative estimates of finite shifts near critical angle. As a potential technique for carrying out a meaningful comparison with experiments, a classical method of edge detection is discussed. To this end a line spread Green's function is defined which can be used to determine the effective transfer function of the near critical angle behavior of divergent plane waves. The process yields a distributed (blurred) output with a line spread function characteristic of the inverse square root nature of the Goos-Hanchen shift equation. A parameter of interest for measurement is given by the edge shift function. Modern imaging and image processing methods provide suitable techniques for exploiting the edge shift phenomena to attain refractive index sensitivities of the order of 10(-6), comparable with the recent results reported in the literature.","Gray, JF; Puri, A",3,16,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,Quantitative method for measurement of the Goos-Hanchen effect based on source divergence considerations,2007
"We study the lateral shift of a light beam transmitted from an indefinite medium slab. The analytic expressions for the transmission coefficient and the lateral shift are obtained by using the stationary-phase method, and different conditions for the occurrence of a negative lateral shift are deduced. It is shown that the thickness of the indefinite medium strongly affects the properties of the lateral shift. For a larger thickness, the sign of the lateral shift depends only on the signs of the permittivity and permeability, while, for a smaller thickness, the sign of the lateral shift is determined by the combined effect of the incident angle of the light, the signs of the permittivity and permeability, and the thickness of the indefinite medium slab. In addition, the lateral shift at the transmitted resonance points is found to be enhanced greatly, and the sign of the lateral shift around the transmitted resonance points is strongly dependent on the permittivity and permeability of the indefinite medium.

"It is predicted that the Goos-Hanchen displacement in the usual frustrated total internal reflection configuration can be resonantly enhanced greatly by coating a dielectric thin film onto the surface of the first prism when the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle for total reflection at the prism-vacuum interface and is smaller than but close to the critical angle for total reflection at the prism-film interface. Theoretical analysis shows that the displacement of transmitted beam is about half the displacement of reflected beam in the thick limit of the vacuum gap between the two prisms. This is to be compared with the relation in the usual symmetric double-prism configuration that the displacement of transmitted beam is equal to the displacement of reflected beam. Numerical simulations for a Gaussian incident beam of waist width of 100 wavelengths reveal that when the dielectric thin film is of the order of wavelength in thickness, both the reflected and transmitted beams maintain well the shape of the incident beam in the thick limit of the vacuum gap. So largely enhanced displacements would lead to applications in optical devices and integrated optics.

"Light. laments or optical spatial solitons are self-confined (non-spreading) beams that originate from the balance between diffraction and self-focusing in nonlinear optical media (those with a response dependent on the level of excitation)(1-3).

"The self-image profiles in a multimode waveguide can be estimated from the phase relations of the guided-modes. However, in NMI theory, the propagation constants of each guided-mode are defined as a perfectly confined condition. Because of the effect of the Goos-Hanchen shift, there are large phase differences for each guided-mode between the predictions of NMI theory and the actual phenomena. Because the relative phases of the guided-modes are not the same as the theoretical ones in a multimode waveguide, it is possible that an undefined self-image can be produced. In this paper, such a phenomenon is called the 'pseudo-self-imaging phenomenon'. This phenomenon can be observed in both the simulation and the experimental results. The excess loss has been measured, and the results are the same as -0.5dB for both the 1st 0-dB self-image and the Ist pseudo-self-image. These results may have been occurred by the phase mismatch of the guided-modes. The extinction ratios are also measured, and the results are 15.5dB for the 0-dB selfimage and 16.2dB for the pseudo-self-image. From the result, it is shown that the pseudo-self-image is formed after the 0-dB self-image and the pseudo-self-images' intensity can be higher then the 0-dB self-images.","Hong, JK; Lee, SS",0,12,"PASSIVE COMPONENTS AND FIBER-BASED DEVICES III, PTS 1 AND 2",Pseudo-self-imaging phenomenon in multimode waveguide and its application,2006
"In solar control devices based on total internal reflection and microstructured surfaces, the Goos-Hanchen shift can lead to a significant decrease in the geometrical optical solar shading effect. The knowledge of the maximal size of the GoosHanchen shift for a specific geometry is an important information to estimate its effect on the desired function of the system. Quantitative measurements of the shift for optical wavelengths seems not feasible and analytical approaches are not suited to identify the maximal shift.

"The travel time of electromagnetic waves in conductive strata has a quantitative relation to the conductivity, permittivity, and permeability of the strata. Using these parameters, geologists can determine the lithology of rocks. But current logging and exploration methods take the time between incidence and reflection as zero and do not take into account the effect of the lateral shift delay when the electromagnetic wave is reflected on the interface of strata. In this article, the lateral shift delay will be considered and a more accurate relationship between petrophysics and electromagnetic wave travel time will be derived. The lateral shift delay of quasi-total reflection of inhomogeneous s-polarized electromagnetic waves (whose electric field is perpendicular to the incident plane) caused by the Goos-Hanchen effect is derived using the phase shift of the wave. The result fits both low and high frequency electromagnetic waves. But for geologists, the most valuable frequency range is between 10(6) and 10(9) Hz (1 MHz-1 GHz, wavelengths between 0.1 and 100 m). A numerical example where the frequency equals to 1 GHz. shows three discontinuous points at the critical angle of phase shift, the critical angle of attenuation and 90 degrees. When the incident angle equals one of these three angles, the lateral shift delay will become infinite. That is, the electromagnetic wave will propagate along the interface. Even when the incident angle is close to one of them, the lateral shift delay is very large. The results also indicate that the two critical angles have an important relation to conductivity and permittivity of the two strata, and that the lateral shift delay has a relation to the incident angle. These results can be used to determine the lithology of the strata and to divide the strata more effectively. It is suggested that this approach may prove useful in electromagnetic logging analysis and, perhaps, in the design of logging instruments.","Liu, FP; Chen, HG; Yang, CC; Li, RZ",2,16,MATHEMATICAL GEOLOGY,Refinement in the reflection properties of electromagnetic waves at a stratigraphic interface,2005

Goos-Hanchen shifts are investigated when total reflection occurs at the interfaces associated with single-negative materials (SNMs). A general rule for judging the direction of the Goos-Hanchen lateral shift concerning lossless media is obtained: Whether the lateral shift is positive or negative depends on the sign of mu(1)mu(2) for TE-polarized incident beams and epsilon(1)epsilon(2) for TM-polarized incident beams. It was theoretically demonstrated that, at the interface associated with SNMs, TE- and TM-polarized incident beams experience opposite Goos-Hanchen lateral shifts.

"Linear micro-reflector arrays are used in various lighting applications where the selectivity between high reflectance for a defined range of angles of incidence and transmittance for other angles of incidence is most interesting. One goal is to miniaturize the unit elements in order to make the devices thinner and to give them a more homogeneous appearance. Diffraction effects then have to be taken into consideration. The scalability of the unit element in linear micro-reflector arrays was studied by using rigorous diffraction theories for periods between 1 and 60 mum. Two principally different geometries of the single micro-reflector were compared: a prism at which two prism surfaces enclose an angle of 90degrees, and a compound parabolic concentrator. The results show that the scalability depends on the structure geometry and the refractive index of the transparent material. The role of evanescent waves on the scalability of micro-reflector arrays is emphasized.

This new behavior includes a null in the field for the S polarization.,"Arenberg, JW",1,7,LASER-INDUCED DAMAGE IN OPTICAL MATERIALS: 2003,Calculation of the electric field magnitude at total internal reflection surfaces,2003
We have studied the total reflection regime through a model represented by a region separating two dielectric bulk media with well-defined refraction indexes. This region is considered to be an interface in which the following hypotheses are established: - Refraction index linear variation with the transition from one medium to the other. - The thickness depends on the optical phenomenon supposedly produced in the interface. The results we obtained were in close agreement with those obtained by authors who have studied this regime through a fundamentally different treatment.,"Delgado, M; Delgado, E",4,19,OPTIK,Evaluation of a total reflection set-up by an interface geometric model,2003

"A study of X waves undergoing frustrated total internal reflection at a planar slab is provided. This is achieved by choosing the spectral plane wave components of the incident X wave to fall on the upper interface at angles greater than the critical angle. Thus, evanescent fields are generated in the slab and the peak of the field tunneling through the slab appears to be transmitted at a superluminal speed. Furthermore, it is shown that for deep barrier penetration, the peak of the transmitted field emerges from the rear interface of the slab before the incident peak reaches the front interface. To understand this advanced transmission of the peak of the pulse, a detailed study of the behavior of the evanescent fields in the barrier region is undertaken. The difference in tunneling behavior between deep and shallow barrier penetrations is shown to be influenced by the sense of the Goos-Hanchen shift.","Shaarawi, AM; Tawfik, BH; Besieris, IM",6,39,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Superluminal advanced transmission of X waves undergoing frustrated total internal reflection: The evanescent fields and the Goos-Hanchen effect,2002
Spatial displacements of three-dimensional Gaussian beams diffracted at a reflection grating are studied theoretically and numerically. The complex diffraction coefficients (amplitudes and phases) of the grating diffracted plane waves calculated by a rigorous method for conical diffraction are the basis for this investigation. The classical analytical formula for the longitudinal shift depending on the gradient of the reflection phase is generalized to the simultaneous analytical treatment of the longitudinal Goos-Hanchen like shift as well as a transverse shift. A second method uses the full integration on the whole spectrum of plane waves of the diffracted beam.,"Guther, R; Kleemann, BH; Elschner, J; Schmidt, G",4,21,JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS,Determination of longitudinal and transverse shifts of three-dimensional Gaussian beams reflected at a grating near an anomaly,2002
An original approach to directly measuring the Goos-Hanchen longitudinal shift between TE and TM polarization states during a total internal reflection is introduced. The technique is based on the modulation of the polarization state of a laser by an electro-optic modulator combined with a precise measurement of the resulting spatial displacement with a position-sensitive detector. This method presents many advantages over other techniques and allows measurements at different wavelengths over a broad range for the incident angle.

"The strong incident-angle dependence of the phase of complex reflectivity causes a shift of the reflected beam from the geometrically expected path. This effect, known as the Goos-Hanchen effect in the visible region, was observed for Bragg-case diffraction in the hard X-ray region. The shift was found to be in good agreement with the theory.","Tamasaku, K; Ishikawa, T",6,6,ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION A,The Goos-Hanchen effect at Bragg diffraction,2002
"It is predicted that the Goos-Hanchen effect can be resonantly enhanced by placing a metallic quantum well (ultrathin film) at the dielectric-vacuum (air) interface. We study the enhancement of the phenomenon, as it appears in frustrated total internal reflection with p-polarized light, both theoretically and numerically. Starting from boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field, which in a self-consistent manner take into account the quantum-well dynamics, we derive new expressions for the amplitude reflection and transmission coefficients of light, and from these the stationary phase approximation to the Goos-Hanchen shifts is obtained. It is shown that large peaks appear in the Goos-Hanchen shift below the critical angle in reflection, and these are located at the minima for the energy reflection coefficient. Both positive and negative shifts may occur, and the number of peaks depends on the gap width. To determine the accuracy of the simple stationary phase approximation, we carry out a rigorous stationary energy-transport calculation of the Goes-Hanchen shift. Although the overall agreement between the two approaches is good, the stationary phase approach mostly overestimates the peak heights. For a Gaussian incident beam, the resonance displacement of the reflected beam can be as large as the Gaussian width parameter. It is suggested that the possible relation between the Goos-Hanchen effect and the optical tunneling phenomenon in the two-prism configuration should be reinvestigated by depositing quantum wells on the glass-vacuum interfaces to obtain a better spatial photon localization.

"This is a comment on Stahlhofen's paper [Phys. Rev. A 62, 012112 (2000)]. It is shown by stationary-phase theory that the Goos-Hanchen shift in frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) is not independent of the group delay (or phase time in the literature). The group delay involves the contribution of Goos-Hanchen shift and is always larger than zero in FTIR. It is also shown that the group delay in the two-dimensional (2D) optical FTIR can be written in the same form as that of the group delay in the 1D quantum tunneling in the sense that the group delay is the derivative of the total phase shift with respect to the angular frequency.","Li, CF",19,7,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,"Comment on ""Photonic tunneling time in frustrated total internal reflection""",2002

"It was recently predicted [1] that the frustrated Gires-Tournois interferometer exhibits a negative delay time for reflection, Given its 100% reflectivity, this appears to contradict causality, We demonstrate that an additional, positive, contribution comes from consideration of the transverse dimension.

We consider linear interfaces, that is. we assume that the spectral components of the vector field in the diffracted pulse are linearly related with the spectral components of the vector field in the incident pulse. In our analysis pulse deformations are described in terms of the following effects: time delay, focal displacement. waist modification and change in propagation velocity. Expressions for these effects, the time domain analogues of those already reported in the spatial domain. are given and compared with those obtained using the stationary phase method.

"Geometrical optics prohibits any penetration of light into an optically rarer medium in the case of total reflection. When sandwiching, however, the rarer medium between optically denser media, a transmitted beam can be observed in the third medium. The experiment is often realized by a double-prism arrangement [1]; the effect is called frustrated total reflection due to the enforced transmission. Amazingly, the reflected and transmitted beams are shifted with respect to geometrical optics as conjectured by Newton [2] and experimentally confirmed by Goos-Hanchen 250 years later [3]. However, inconsistent results on the spatial shifts have been reported [4-7]. Here we report on measurements of the Goos-Hanchen shift in frustrated total reflection with microwaves. We found an unexpected influence of the beamwidth and angle of incidence on the shift. Our results are not in agreement with both previous experiments [6,7] and theoretical predictions [8-10]. The topic of frustrated total reflection is important for both fundamental research and applications [11-13].","Haibel, A; Nimtz, G; Stahlhofen, AA",93,23,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Frustrated total reflection: The double-prism revisited,2001
"It is shown that, when Laguerre-Gaussian light beam with non-zero azimuthal index is partially reflected at plane interface of two isotropic transparent media, a specific deformation of the beam occurs in this process. This deformation gives rise a transverse shift of the centre of gravity of the reflected beam. When the beam is incident from a denser medium at an angle that is close to the critical angle for total reflection, the magnitude of the predicted shift, like the magnitude of the well-known lateral or Goos-Hanchen shift, can be many wavelengths.","Fedoseyev, V",5,14,SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SINGULAR OPTICS (OPTICAL VORTICES): FUNDAMENTALS AND APPLICATIONS,Transverse and lateral shifts of the centre of gravity of Laguerre-Gaussian light beam at reflection,2001
"The (two-dimensional) wave beam fields and the associated energy flux in the Goos-Hanchen effect are studied analytically and numerically. In particular, the time-averaged Poynting vector and its flux lines around the interface are calculated for both states of wave polarization, irrespective of a positive shift (the usual one) or a negative shift of the reflected beam. For a given transverse field profile of the incident beam, the flux lines associated with the evanescent waves for the two cases of shift are shown to have the same shape yet to take opposite directions: they are parabolas if the profile is Gaussian. The flux lines in the first medium are shown to connect to those in the second medium on the two sides of the interface. In the case of positive shift, the whole flux pattern expectedly shows the supply of energy from the incident beam to the evanescent wave on one side and the return of energy on the other side to the reflected beam. In the case of negative shift, on the other hand, the flux lines nearby the interface form loops, in addition to the expected incoming-outgoing flux pattern in the remaining region.","Lai, HM; Kwok, CW; Loo, YW; Xu, BY",76,32,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,Energy-flux pattern in the Goos-Hanchen effect,2000
Frustrated total internal reflection is considered as the classical analog of quantum-mechanical tunneling. Here the tunneling time in frustrated total internal reflection is discussed. It is shown that the phase time allows for vanishing and negative barrier traversal times. The tunneling time is shown to be dominated by a time scale based on the Goos-Hanchen shift. The role of further nonspecular deformations of the transmitted beam is addressed.

"We have designed a structure for a 2x2 silica-based optical waveguide switch that is based on a thermocapillarity effect.

This switch can provide a cross/bar function through a single element, and the measured reflection losses in the reflection walls on both sides of the slit were consistent. The loss was comparable to the insertion loss of a Mach-Zender-interferometer-type thermo-optic switch. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

"Longitudinal and transverse shifts of a light beam at total internal reflection was experimentally studied by far-field measurements on the reflected field. We propose to use a scanning tunneling optical microscope (STOM) to study these shifts in transmission, and we present a theoretical model of this proposed experiment to obtain a numerical estimation of these shifts. We study the reflection and the transmission of a three-dimensional polarized incident beam. We verify the validity of our formalism by studying the Goos-Hanchen shift in reflection and by comparing our results with published ones. Then we calculate STOM images of the transmitted field distribution. On the images the well-known Goos-Hanchen shift is easily observed. But we also encounter a smaller shift, perpendicular to the plane of incidence. This transverse shift was also observed in reflection by Imbert and Levy [Nouv. Rev. Opt. 6, 285 (1975)]. We study the variations of the two shifts versus various parameters such as the angle of incidence, the optical index, and the incident polarization. Then we discuss the feasibility of the near-field observation of these shifts.

"The grating diffraction of beams is theoretically investigated by applying an electromagnetic method (the Integral Equation System Method with Parametrization of the grating profile=IESMP) to their plane wave components. For the first time, explicit values for the displacement of grating diffracted Gaussian beams are calculated with this method. For total reflection this displacement of beams is known as the Goos-Hanchen shift. A maximum shift of 36 mu m has been found for the investigated sinusoidal grating near an anomaly which is much greater than the known Goos-Hanchen shift of about 1 mu m for the total reflection case. The replacement of the angular spectrum of plane waves with constant wavelength by a wavelength spectrum of plane waves of constant direction allows an analogous treatment of short-time pulses. Surprisingly, the above anomaly causes a maximum temporal shift of 80 fs for the pulse diffraction. These temporal shifts and additional effects like pulse deformations can influence ultra short-time pulse experiments. Furthermore, the behaviour of temporally and spatially Gaussian shaped light pulses (TSG pulses) by grating diffraction are studied considering the diffraction of an angular ann wavelength dependent spectrum of plane waves. The diffraction of a short TSG pulse at the above grating deforms the pulse and creates an additional smaller satellite pulse. All described effects occur only at positions of the space-time complex filtering function in the angular-wavelength frequency space with high gradient of the phase.","Guther, R; Kleemann, BH",13,27,JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS,Shift and shape of grating diffracted beams,1998

"A rigorous spectral analysis is given for the nonspecular reflection of a three-dimensional Gaussian beam at a dielectric isotropic planar structure. For the first time all independent nonspecular effects are derived in a self-consistent manner for the three-dimensional case. It is shown that the longitudinal nonspecular effects in the incidence plane, that is, the lateral and focal shifts of the beam waist position, the angular rotation of the reflected-beam axis, and the modifications of the beam waist width and complex amplitude, have their direct analogies in the plane transverse to the incidence and interface planes that gives transverse nonspecular effects. Moreover, the existence of the other, not yet reported, effect of nonspecular modification of the beam polarization is also proved. A role for TM and TE polarizations in reflected-beam formation is indicated.

The spatial modifications of electromagnetic beams of finite size reflected at plane isotropic-uniaxial interfaces are investigated theoretically. It is shown that the lateral displacement of the beam is a maximum at two angles of incidence: one below and the other above the critical angle of total reflection. These angles are very close to those for which the extraordinary and ordinary waves transmitted into the uniaxial media become evanescent.

"A broadening and splitting of the axial spread function is observed when high-numerical-aperture (NA) oil-immersion objectives are used on a confocal microscope to examine dielectric interfaces when the refractive index below the boundary is lower than the NA of the objective. The phenomena is due to total internal reflection probably as a consequence of the Goos-Hanchen shift, If total internal reflection occurs when undertaking confocal microscopy, this shift creates obvious problems when the optical sectioning capabilities must be optimal in reflectance mode and more subtle difficulties can arise when examining fluorescent emission, Alternatively, deliberately inducing total internal reflection can be used to estimate the refractive index in component parts within foams, emulsions and aerated specimens where such measurements can be relatively difficult to make by other means. Furthermore, the examination of total internal reflection with a confocal microscope permits the phenomena of total internal reflection itself to be probed with very high illumination intensities without disturbing the boundary conditions with an external probe, Finally, other changes in the apparent position of the focus were noted to occur when high-NA oil-immersion objectives are used to examine specimens such as metal mirrors.","ENTWISTLE, A",2,18,JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY-OXFORD,THE EFFECTS OF TOTAL INTERNAL-REFLECTION ON THE SPREAD FUNCTION ALONG THE AXIS IN CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY,1995

"A trajectory in the optical wave is presented. The trajectory is an extension of the geometrical ray and runs wherever the wave exists. The optical wave is solved for the composite of the system's continuously varying index of refraction. The wave equation is assumed to be separable into variables, and the constants of separation are the mode parameters specifying the wave. A trajectory for the system in which the plane wave is incident upon an interface of two homogeneous media with different indices of refraction is illustrated. The trajectory runs to and fro across the interface. Shifts of the reflected and transmitted paints from the incident point on the interface occur in addition to the Goos-Hanchen shift for the incident angle greater than the critical angle. A trajectory through the cylindrical Luneburg lens is shown. It passes through the lens without any reflection, as does the corresponding ray. It is deflected attractively or repulsively according to the value of the parameter. It approaches the ray in the short-wavelength limit.","NISHIYAMA, Y",1,12,JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION,TRAJECTORY IN THE OPTICAL-WAVE,1995
"The great sensitivity of laser eigenstates and laser polarization instabilities are shown to be useful to measure small effects. Such instabilities are first used to measure their cause, i.e., the magnetic field. Indeed, it is shown that a ''quasimirrorless laser'' behaves like a macroscopic quantum magnetometer and is sensitive to the mean value of the longitudinal magnetic field. The great sensitivity of laser eigenstates is then used to study some effects which are localized on an intracavity dioptre: the deviations from Snell-Descartes' laws. Using two eigenstates which are successively linearly and helicoidally polarized, one succeeds in measuring the longitudinal shift at total reflection (Goos-Hanchen effect) of a linearly polarized beam and the transverse shift at total reflection of a circularly polarized beam versus angle of incidence and for a single reflection of a perfectly controlled Gaussian beam. In every case, measurements are in good agreement with our calculations.","BRETENAKER, F; DUTRIAUX, L; COTTEVERTE, JC; LEPINE, B; LEFLOCH, A",1,51,ANNALES DE PHYSIQUE,SOME LOCALIZED EFFECTS IN LASERS,1995
"Starting with wave packets, an eigenvalue equation is derived for the amount of time a particle needs for reflection from an impermeable potential barrier. The corresponding Hermitian operator (T) over cap(R) is linear and diagonal in energy space. The eigenvalues are given by

tau(R)(E) = (h) over bar {partial derivative rho(E)/partial derivative E+sin rho(E)/2E}, where rho(E) is the phase shift for stationary reflection at fixed scattering energy E. The quantum mechanical reflection time tau(R)(E) has a well defined WKB-limit. For low scattering energies tau(R)(E) is proportional to root E if weakly bound states are absent in the reflection region. However, if there is an empty weakly bound state it will transiently trap a slowly moving particle, causing a 1/root E divergence of the reflection time for E-->0. We work out and illustrate the theory for various reflecting potentials. The method allows for a consistent treatment of the quantum mechanical Goos-Hanchen time delay.","BRACHER, C; KLEBER, M",10,18,ANNALEN DER PHYSIK,REFLECTION TIME AS AN EIGENVALUE PROBLEM,1995
"We have studied the propagation of plane waves in anisotropic and absorbing films.  The Goos-Hanchen shifts at interfaces of film/metallic overlayer and film/substrate as well as the transverse phase shift of the plane wave travelling in the films have been determined.  Based on these studies, the refractive indices and thicknesses of films have been recovered from theoretical analyses and experimental investigations on the mode dispersion equation of guided waves in the films.","WANG, HM",0,11,JOURNAL OF MODERN OPTICS,CHARACTERIZATION OF A METAL-CLAD ANISOTROPIC THIN-FILM BY THE GUIDED-WAVE METHOD,1994
"In the geometrical-optics framework, the internal fields near morphology-dependent resonances (MDR) of dielectric spheres are represented by rays undergoing total internal reflection at the sphere surface. The round-trip path length of rays circumnavigating the sphere is used to compute the mode spacing of MDR's. The Goos-Hanchen shift of the total internally reflected rays at the sphere surface is included in the ray picture to explain the qualitative behavior of the MDR frequency spacing in the Lorentz-Mie formalism for the entire size-parameter (circumference/wavelength) range. The MDR's are characterized by a radial distance r(m)'. A connection between the ray picture and the Mie theory is established, based on r(m)'.","CHOWDHURY, DQ; LEACH, DH; CHANG, RK",13,40,JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION,EFFECT OF THE GOOS-HANCHEN SHIFT ON THE GEOMETRICAL-OPTICS MODEL FOR SPHERICAL-CAVITY MODE SPACING,1994
An alternative approach to the investigation of the space-time evolution of an electromagnetic field in a nonlinear medium is presented. An adiabatic theory to obtain the dynamic picture of reflection and penetration of electromagnetic radiation into a nonlinear medium is devised. It is based upon the energy balance equation and uses the nonlinear modes of the stationary problem like trial functions. Filamentation and soliton generation are analyzed and the model easily predicts the giant nonlinear Goos-Hanchen beam shifts that emerge from previously numerically intensive investigations. The method is nonperturbative and is straightforward to apply to linear-nonlinear interfaces.,"ALIEV, YM; BOARDMAN, AD; XIE, K; ZHAROV, AA",14,24,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,CONSERVED ENERGY APPROXIMATION TO WAVE SCATTERING BY A NONLINEAR INTERFACE,1994
"A spatial and vectorial description of the eigenmodes and eigenstates of ring lasers is provided. After having studied the tangential and sagittal mode size dynamics due to resonant lenslike effects in one- and two isotope- ring lasers, the non-reciprocity of these mechanisms is shown to explain the biases observed in ring laser gyroscopes. The role of diffraction in the lock-in region is also isolated, allowing us to observe the so-called reverse Sagnac effect. The spatial separation of laser eigenstates is investigated and permits then to build cavities with several propagation axes whose eigenstates must be calculated in the framework of a spatially generalized Jones matrix formalism. This allows, in the case of Fabry-Perot cavity lasers, to control the coupling between eigenstates, to create forked eigenstates, and to build a two-tunable-frequency laser, and, in the case of ring lasers, to cancel the coupling between two counterpropagating eigenstates. The study of the stability and dynamics of eigenstates allows, first, to control the stability of the two eigenstates of various lasers, second, to measure small effects like the Goos-Hanchen shift or to build a mean-field magnetometer in the case where no eigenstate exists, and, third, to investigate the behavior of the four circularly polarized eigenstates of a ring laser in order to create an oscillation regime with two biased counterpropagating eigenstates, whose application as a ring laser gyroscope is discussed.","BRETENAKER, F",0,193,ANNALES DE PHYSIQUE,THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY OF EIGENMODES AND EIGENSTATES IN RING LASERS - APPLICATIONS TO GYROMETRY AND TO THE DETECTION OF SMALL EFFECTS,1993
"A description of the prism-film coupler, with use of the ray picture, was introduced by Tien and Ulrich [J. Opt. Soc. Am. 60, 1325-1336 (1970)]. Here a discussion of this model is given, and it is argued that the effect of the Goos-Hanchen shift cannot be neglected in general. Further, relatively simple expressions are given for the computation of the coupling efficiency of a prism-loaded planar structure as a function of the angle of incidence of the incoming beam. Computational results are presented and compared with those of other methods.","HOEKSTRA, HJWM; VANTSPIJKER, JC; KOERKAMP, HMMK",7,12,JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION,RAY PICTURE FOR PRISM FILM COUPLING,1993

"A theoretical model is developed to predict the behavior of the TE and TM eigenstates of a laser when the Goos-Hanchen effect associated with a total internal reflection inserted inside the laser cavity is taken into account. The generalized Jones matrix describing the internal reflection on a plane interface is determined, and the dynamics of the linearly polarized eigenstates around the critical angle is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, the strong coupling between the TE and TM eigenstates is shown to provide a direct visualization of the Goos-Hanchen lateral shift.","DUTRIAUX, L; LEFLOCH, A; BRETENAKER, F",5,27,JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS,GOOS-HANCHEN EFFECT IN THE DYNAMICS OF LASER EIGENSTATES,1992
"The spatial soliton plays a fundamental role as a robust, particle-like object which can be manipulated to switch or spatially scan collimated light channels or optical pulses which are incident at an oblique angle to an interface separating two or more self-focusing Kerr slab dielectrics. The underlying equivalent particle/multiparticle theory can also be employed to predict stability properties of nonlinear surface or guided waves, to derive an analytic expression for the nonlinear Goos Hanchen shift at a nonlinear interface and to quantify the effect of material diffusion, linear and two-photon absorption on the switching behaviour of the light beam. Pulsed spatial switching effects are studied in order to illustrate the general predictive power of the equivalent particle theory.","MOLONEY, JV; NEWELL, AC; ACEVES, AB",19,29,OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS,SPATIAL SOLITON OPTICAL SWITCHES - A SOLITON-BASED EQUIVALENT PARTICLE APPROACH,1992
"An elementary graphical interpretation of the Goos-Hanchen shift is proposed. It brings to light assumptions usually made in calculations and easily leads to the classical result.

The Goos-Hanchen longitudinal shift at total reflection of an optical Gaussian beam is experimentally investigated for only one reflection. The differential experimental method uses the high sensitivity of the eigenstates of a quasi-isotropic laser to small perturbations to measure an intracavity Goos-Hanchen effect for angles of incidence both below and above the critical angle. The measurements are in good agreement with our calculations of the longitudinal shift for Gaussian laser beams.,"BRETENAKER, F; LEFLOCH, A; DUTRIAUX, L",116,26,PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS,DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF THE OPTICAL GOOS-HANCHEN EFFECT IN LASERS,1992
The lateral Goos-Hanchen 1 beam shift of a monochromatic plane wave incident from a denser magneto-optical surface medium to a rarer magneto-optical surface medium is theoretically investigated using Maxwell's theory.

"A new type of diffraction effect, different from the standard semiclassical ones (rainbow, glory, forward peak, orbiting), takes place near the critical angle for total reflection at a curved interface between two homogeneous media.  A theoretical treatment of this new effect is given for Mie scattering, e.g., light scattering by an air bubble in water; it can readily be extended to more general curved interface problems in a variety of different fields (quantum mechanics, acoustics, seismic waves).  The relatively slowly varying Mie diffraction pattern associated with near-critical scattering is obscured by rapid fine-structure oscillations due to interference with unrelated ""far-side"" contributions.  These contributions are evaluated and subtracted from the Mie amplitudes to yield the relevant ""near-side"" effects.  A zero-order transitional complex angular momentum (CAM) approximation to the near-side amplitude is developed.  The most important contributions arise from partial and total reflection, represented by two new diffraction integrals, designated Fresnel-Fock and Pearcey-Fock, respectively.  The total reflection contribution is strongly affected by tunneling, giving rise to a generalized version of the Goos-Hanchen shift.  In terms of short-wavelength asymptotic methodology, in a generalized Huygens-Fresnel-type integral representation, the new diffraction features arise from nonanalyticity of the integrand amplitude function within the range of a saddle point.  Also discussed are the WKB approximation, a known physical-optics approximation, and a modified version of this approximation:  they are compared with the ""exact"" near-side Mie amplitude obtained by numerical partial-wave summation, at scatterer size parameters (circumference divided by wavelength) ranging from 1000 to 10 000.  It is found that the physical-optics approximations lead to large errors in the near-critical region, whereas the zero-order CAM approximation is in good agreement with the exact solution, accounting for the new diffraction effects in near-critical scattering.","FIEDLERFERRARI, N; NUSSENZVEIG, HM; WISCOMBE, WJ",30,56,PHYSICAL REVIEW A,THEORY OF NEAR-CRITICAL-ANGLE SCATTERING FROM A CURVED INTERFACE,1991
